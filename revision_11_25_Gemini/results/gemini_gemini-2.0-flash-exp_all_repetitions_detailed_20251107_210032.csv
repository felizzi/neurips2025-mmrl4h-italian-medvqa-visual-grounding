Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL. This indicates an anterior STEMI, which is most likely caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).",True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: Without any clinical context or ECG data, it is impossible to determine the correct answer definitively. However, among the given options relating to cardiac issues (A, C, and D), occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery is the most common cause of significant myocardial infarction. Options B and E are unrelated to coronary occlusion. Therefore, the most probable answer in the absence of further information is C.",True
1,IT0031,"[Paziente uomo di 85 anni, pregresso ictus ischemico, diabetico, in terapia polifarmacologica.

Reasoning: The patient is elderly with a history of previous ischemic stroke, diabetes, and is on polypharmacy. The presentation is of diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled blisters that are intensely pruritic. This clinical presentation is characteristic of bullous pemphigoid. The image also shows large tense bullae on an erythematous base which supports the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. Pemphigus vulgaris would be less likely given tense rather than flaccid bullae, and the absence of mucosal involvement. Herpes zoster presents with dermatomal distribution. Contact dermatitis is generally localized and not characterized by large tense bullae. Bullous impetigo typically occurs in children and presents with more superficial flaccid bullae.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy. He presents with diffuse erythematous urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae that are intensely pruritic. This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease common in the elderly. The initial urticarial plaques are a common early feature.

Pemfigo volgare is less likely because the bullae are typically flaccid and easily rupture, and mucosal involvement is common. Herpes zoster typically presents with a dermatomal distribution and painful vesicles. Contact dermatitis typically presents with a localized distribution related to an external irritant or allergen. Bullous impetigo is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus and presents with superficial, fragile bullae, and would be less likely to present with diffuse urticarial plaques initially.",True
1,IT0032,"[Paziente uomo di 85 anni, pregresso ictus ischemico, diabetico, in terapia polifarmacologica. Da circa un mese comparsa di placche eritematose orticarioidi diffuse con successiva comparsa di bolle tese a contenuto limpido. Le lesioni sono intensamente pruriginose.] Qual è il procedimento diagnostico più appropriato?",B,True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with widespread urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled blisters. The lesions are intensely pruritic. This presentation suggests a bullous dermatosis.
A) is incorrect because it relates to celiac disease, which is unlikely given the bullous lesions.
B) is the most appropriate answer. A skin biopsy for histology can help identify the level of blister formation (epidermal vs dermal). Direct immunofluorescence is crucial to detect antibody deposition along the basement membrane zone, which is characteristic of bullous pemphigoid or other subepidermal bullous diseases. This will also help identify the specific target antigen.
C) Dermatoscopy might be useful, but not the most appropriate initial diagnostic step.
D) Tzanck smear is more useful for detecting multinucleated giant cells in herpes infections, not for diagnosing bullous dermatoses.
E) is not the most appropriate first choice. While pemphigus should be considered, it would cause flaccid blisters as opposed to tense blisters, and the associated antibodies would attack desmoglein. Bullous pemphigoid is more probable given the description and age of patient. Therefore, ruling out basement membrane antibody first is better. Also, anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 are associated with pemphigus, whereas anti-basement membrane antibodies are associated with bullous pemphigoid. Since the description is more consistent with bullous pemphigoid, testing for anti-basement membrane antibodies first would be better.
The image confirms presence of tense blisters. Therefore, bullous pemphigoid is high in the differential and biopsy with DIF for anti-BMZ antibody is the most appropriate.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear-fluid-filled bullae, and intense pruritus. This clinical picture suggests a bullous dermatosis. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific type of bullous dermatosis is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence, along with the search for anti-basement membrane antibodies. This is because various bullous diseases have specific histological and immunofluorescence patterns, as well as specific antibody targets within the skin. Option A is related to celiac disease diagnosis. Options C and D are less specific and less helpful in determining the precise diagnosis. Option E focuses specifically on desmogleins 1 and 3, which are primarily associated with pemphigus vulgaris and foliaceus. Considering the patient's presentation, the differential diagnosis is broader than just pemphigus and could include bullous pemphigoid or other subepidermal bullous diseases, thus requiring a broader antibody search in addition to histological assessment.",True

Reasoning: In a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association is the odds ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of exposed cases, 'b' is the number of exposed controls, 'c' is the number of unexposed cases, and 'd' is the number of unexposed controls.
From the table, we have:

d = 386
So, OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). This matches option C.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question describes a case-control study. In case-control studies, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between an exposure and an outcome. The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where a is the number of cases with exposure, b is the number of cases without exposure, c is the number of controls with exposure, and d is the number of controls without exposure. The option C is the only formula describing correctly the Odds Ratio in this context.

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and take less time to complete than other study designs (e.g., cohort studies or randomized controlled trials). Options B, C, D, and E all involve calculating incidence or prevalence, which is not typically done in case-control studies. Case-control studies are good for studying rare diseases or outcomes. They start with cases (those with the disease) and controls (those without the disease) and look backward to see if there are differences in exposures or risk factors. Incidence and prevalence require following a population over time or at a point in time, respectively, which is not how case-control studies are designed.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and quicker to conduct than other study designs like cohort studies. Incidence and prevalence calculations are not possible in case-control studies, as they start with cases and controls rather than a defined population.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min) and the ECG shows ST-segment elevation in V1-V6 leads, consistent with an anterior STEMI. Given these findings, it is important to administer antiplatelet therapy as quickly as possible. Ticagrelor is a potent P2Y12 inhibitor that should be administered as a loading dose to reduce the risk of thrombotic events. Sodium Nitroprussiate would worsen the hypotension. Diltiazem is inappropriate in acute STEMI. Warfarin is an anticoagulant and not indicated at this point. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor and contraindicated given the hypotension. Therefore, ticagrelor is the correct choice.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient is a 48-year-old smoker with hypertension, presenting with epigastric pain and hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and 99% oxygen saturation. The ECG (although not clearly visible) suggests a possible acute coronary syndrome given the chest pain. Given the need to alert the hemodynamics team, the patient likely requires intervention for a cardiac event. Ticagrelor is an antiplatelet agent that is indicated in acute coronary syndromes and should be administered. Nitroprussiate is a vasodilator that is not appropriate due to the low blood pressure. Diltiazem will further reduce heart rate and potentially cause further drops in blood pressure, therefore also not appropriate. Warfarin is a long-term anticoagulant that will not provide the needed antiplatelet affect in the acute setting and Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor, that is currently part of his normal medication. Given the hypotensive state, adding more is not the best option.",True

Reasoning: The patient is a 48-year-old male, smoker, hypertensive on ACE inhibitors, complaining of epigastric pain for approximately 6 hours. His vital signs show hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57 bpm), and normal oxygen saturation (99%). The ECG (although very difficult to discern any details) shows ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which points towards an inferior wall myocardial infarction. This is most commonly caused by an occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). Therefore, the most likely location of the lesion is the right coronary artery.",True

Quale reperto è verosimilmente apprezzabile alla TC?",C,True,D,"IT0095, D
Reasoning: The patient's neurological exam (unresponsive, withdrawing from pain, anisocoria) after a motor vehicle accident suggests a possible traumatic brain injury. The CT scan shows a hyperdense, crescent-shaped lesion conforming to the shape of the skull, displacing the brain parenchyma, which is consistent with an acute subdural hematoma.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's clinical presentation (unresponsiveness, anisocoria, motor response to pain) after a high-impact trauma suggests a severe brain injury with potential for intracranial hemorrhage. Anisocoria is a sign of possible herniation caused by a mass effect. Given the acute nature of the trauma, an intraparenchymal hematoma (A) is a likely finding on CT scan, reflecting direct damage to the brain tissue. While subdural and epidural hematomas are also possible, intraparenchymal hemorrhage is very common after trauma, especially in the setting of diffuse axonal injury. Chronic subdural hematomas are less likely given the acute presentation. Subgaleal hematomas are external to the skull and would not explain the neurological findings.",False

Reasoning: The image shows a side view of the lumbar spine, displaying the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other. This is characteristic of a sagittal plane. Options D and E also mention sagittal planes, but are oblique, which the image does not appear to be. Option B (coronal) would show a front view of the spine, and Option C (axial) would show a cross-sectional view.",True
1,IT0131,[Paziente di 45 anni esegue indagine Risonanza Magnetica della colonna lombare per lombalgia da 2 mesi non responsiva ai farmaci antifiammatori.] Nella RM si rileva una probabile metastasi ossea. Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: Since the RM shows a probable bone metastasis, the most appropriate test for identifying the presence of bone metastases is a bone scan (scintigrafia ossea). It is more sensitive than conventional radiography for detecting early bone involvement. While a CT scan can detect bone metastases, it is typically used when more detailed anatomical information is needed or if the bone scan is equivocal. A whole-body CT scan with contrast is not usually the first-line investigation. Ultrasound is not useful to image bone. CT with low dose protocol is not a standard.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate examination to identify bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive method for detecting bone metastases because it shows areas of increased bone turnover, which is often associated with metastatic disease. While CT scans can also detect bone metastases, bone scintigraphy is generally more sensitive, especially for early lesions. A whole-body CT scan with contrast (option C) exposes the patient to a higher radiation dose and contrast media, which may not be necessary as the initial investigation. A selective ultrasound is unsuitable for screening for metastases in the entire skeleton. Low-dose CT would not be as sensitive as scintigraphy.",True

Reasoning: The image from the esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows a loss of the normal villous architecture of the mucosa, which is indicative of mucosal atrophy. This is consistent with a suspicion of malabsorption. There are no signs of fistulas, abscesses, neoformation, bleeding or ulcers in the image.",True,B,"IT0136, B

Reasoning: The patient presents with eritemato-ipercheratosiche lesions, alopecia cicatriziale, and lesions that worsen with sun exposure and tend to cause atrophic scarring. These findings are suggestive of Lupus Erythematosus (LE), specifically Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE). Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for DLE. Phototherapy is contraindicated as the lesions worsen with sun exposure. Calcipotriol is used for psoriasis, not LE. Penicillin is an antibiotic and not relevant in this context. Antifungal medications are for fungal infections, which are not indicated by the clinical picture. Therefore, Hydroxychloroquine is the most appropriate treatment option.",True,B,"IT0169, B
Reasoning: The description points towards discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). The key features include:

Reasoning: The histological findings described - villous atrophy (flattening of the villi), crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes - are classic features of celiac disease. While other conditions can cause some of these features, the combination is highly suggestive of celiac disease. Whipple's disease typically involves PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria.

Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden headache and vomiting followed by aphasia and right hemiparesis. The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left fronto-parietal region, consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient's history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis increases the likelihood of spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The location of the hemorrhage (left fronto-parietal) explains the aphasia (due to involvement of language areas) and the right hemiparesis.
A hematoma epidural typically presents with a lucid interval, which is not described in the question. An acute subdural hematoma would have a crescent shape. Ischemic stroke would typically not appear hyperdense on initial CT scan without contrast. Subarachnoid hemorrhage would show blood in the subarachnoid space.

Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis. The history includes hypertension and liver cirrhosis due to alcoholism. Examination reveals a soporific patient with global aphasia and right hemiplegia. The CT scan (while not very clear in the provided image) is suggestive of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left fronto-parietal region. The patient's symptoms and history of hypertension make intraparenchymal hemorrhage the most likely diagnosis. The aphasia indicates left hemisphere involvement and hemiparesis on the right side confirms this. Epidural and subdural hematomas are less likely given the patient's history and the presentation. Subarachnoid hemorrhage would likely present with more severe headache and a different pattern on the CT scan. Ischemic stroke, while possible, is less likely to present with the acute onset of symptoms along with vomiting. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage.",True
1,IT0236,"[Una donna di 76 anni riferisce di sentire, da alcuni mesi, il braccio di destra più debole; tale disturbo sembra avere un andamento peggiorativo. Nelle ultime settimane sarebbero inoltre comparse delle difficoltà nell'eloquio. La paziente si reca quindi dal neurologo che riscontra un deficit stenico all'arto superiore di destra e una afasia espressiva. Consiglia quindi l'esecuzione di una RM encefalo con mezzo di contrasto. Tale esame evidenzia la presenza di una lesione espansiva verosimilmente extra-assiale a livello frontale destro, captante vivacemente e omogeneamente contrasto, associata a ispessimento della dura madre perilesionale (tail durale) (si veda immagine).] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description mentions a 76-year-old woman with a progressive weakness in the right arm and speech difficulties (expressive aphasia). The MRI reveals an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal region that enhances intensely and homogeneously with contrast and has a dural tail. The key findings point towards a meningioma.

Here's why the other options are less likely:
- B) Glioma: Gliomas are intra-axial, meaning they originate within the brain tissue itself, not extra-axial (outside the brain tissue).
- C) Metastasis: While metastasis is possible, the description of a single, well-defined, extra-axial, enhancing lesion with a dural tail is more characteristic of a meningioma. Also, the location is in the right frontal region as opposed to the right temporal region.
- D) Subdural Hematoma: Subdural hematomas are collections of blood and typically appear as crescent-shaped collections on imaging, without intense contrast enhancement or a dural tail. They also present more acutely.
- E) Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: Hemorrhages will appear bright on imaging. Also, hemorrhages occur inside the brain tissue and are not extra-axial.

The image confirms a round, extra-axial mass in the right frontal region with a clear dural base and homogenous enhancement, further supporting the diagnosis of a meningioma. The symptoms (right arm weakness and expressive aphasia) correlate well with the location of the lesion (left frontal, causing issues in the right side of the body and speech). The options are inverted left-right, this is why it is a meningioma of the *left* frontal.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description points towards a lesion that is extra-axial, located in the right frontal lobe, enhances homogeneously with contrast, and presents a dural tail. Also the symptoms indicate an involvement of the right frontal area, leading to left sided weakness and speech difficulties. Meningiomas are typically extra-axial, can show homogeneous contrast enhancement, and often have a dural tail. Given the location and these characteristics, a meningioma is the most probable diagnosis. The lesion causing right weakness with aphasia would be located in the left hemisphere.

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with night pain in the thigh that is relieved by aspirin. The images show a lesion in the bone, typical of osteoid osteoma. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) relieves pain in osteoid osteoma due to its prostaglandin-inhibiting effect. The images show the central nidus surrounded by sclerotic bone, which is characteristic of osteoid osteoma. The other options (chondroblastoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and enchondroma) are less likely given the patient's age, the location of the lesion, and the relief of pain with aspirin.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly nocturnal, that regresses after taking acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). This is a classic presentation of osteoid osteoma. Osteoid osteomas often cause nocturnal pain that is relieved by NSAIDs like aspirin. The other options are less likely to present with this specific pattern of pain relief with aspirin.",True

Reasoning: The image shows papules and plaques in the perineal region, which are likely condylomata acuminata (genital warts) caused by HPV. Treatments like sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgical removal are all appropriate for treating genital warts. Salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used to treat genital warts and may even worsen the condition. Corticosteroids can suppress the immune system, which is not desirable in this case. Therefore, topical therapy with salicylic acid and corticosteroids is not indicated.",True,E,"IT0311, E
Reasoning: The question describes perineal papules, possibly condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, surgery, and imiquimod are all treatments for condylomata acuminata.

Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows a complete loss of lung markings on the left side with a sharp line representing the visceral pleura. The lung is collapsed. The mediastinum is also shifted to the right. These findings are consistent with a left pneumothorax. A pneumothorax can be life-threatening if it leads to tension pneumothorax. Hemothorax would appear as an opacity in the hemithorax, not a complete lack of lung markings. Cardiomegaly is not indicated here, neither is tracheal stenosis or aortic dissection.",True,C,"IT0340, C

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense collection abutting the inner table of the skull. This is consistent with an acute subdural hematoma. A GCS of 8/15 further supports the possibility of a significant brain injury. The hematoma causes mass effect, and there is sulcal effacement. Epidural hematomas are typically lenticular (biconvex). Intraparenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhages typically have different appearances on CT. Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically involves the sulci and cisterns.",True,B,"IT0375, B

Reasoning: A displaced fracture of the mid-shaft of the humerus carries a high risk of radial nerve injury. The radial nerve wraps around the humerus in the spiral groove. Median and ulnar nerve injuries are less likely with this specific fracture pattern. Pulmonary thromboembolism is a general complication of any fracture but is not the most immediate complication of this specific fracture. Brachial artery lesion could be a potential complication, but the radial nerve is the most frequently affected structure.",True,C,"IT0390, C
Reasoning: A displaced fracture of the middle third of the humeral diaphysis is most frequently associated with injury to the radial nerve. The radial nerve courses in the spiral groove on the posterior aspect of the humerus, making it vulnerable in this type of fracture. Lesions to the median, ulnar, or brachial artery are less common.

The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, S1Q3T3 pattern (S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and inverted T wave in lead III). These are classic findings in pulmonary embolism. Recent surgery increases the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Although some other options could cause dyspnea, the combination of factors present and the ECG point most strongly towards PE. Brugada would not explain the symptoms presented. Dissection would have chest pain. Scompenso is possible, but PE is more likely given the S1Q3T3 and recent prostatectomy. Anemia could cause dyspnea but not to this acute and drastic level and the ECG does not particularly suggest ischemia.",True,B,"IT0456, B

Reasoning: The patient presents with difficulty walking, speech disturbance, and right-sided weakness, along with a history of head trauma 4 weeks prior. He is also on warfarin, which increases the risk of bleeding. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense relative to the brain parenchyma. This description is characteristic of a chronic subdural hematoma. Acute subdural hematomas are typically hyperdense, and epidural hematomas are often lens-shaped.

Reasoning: The ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with the absence of P waves and the presence of fibrillatory waves. This is characteristic of atrial fibrillation. The QRS complexes appear narrow, suggesting that the rhythm is supraventricular. There are no ST segment elevations or depressions suggestive of ischemia, no clear flutter waves, no wide QRS complexes indicating ventricular tachycardia, and no progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a dropped beat that would indicate Mobitz type I AV block. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is atrial fibrillation. Hashimoto's thyroiditis might lead to thyroid disfunction which in turn may cause atrial fibrillation.",True,A,"IT0593, A

Reasoning: The patient presents with classic signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pain, diaphoresis, and jugular constriction. He is hypertensive and dyslipidemic, increasing the risk. The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V4, indicative of an anterior STEMI. In this situation, the next step is emergent coronary angiography (<2h) for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to re-establish coronary blood flow. Troponin levels are helpful but take time to result and should not delay emergent angiography in the setting of STEMI. An angio-CT would be more appropriate in the evaluation of other causes of chest pain such as aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism which are less likely in this scenario.
Ruling out inflammatory or viral causes is not the immediate priority in this case.
A coronary angiography within 24h is not sufficient for ST-elevation MI.
Therefore, the best course of action is emergent coronary angiography (<2h).",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, and jugular vein distension, suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG (though not visible) is crucial for diagnosis. Given the description, if the ECG shows ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the immediate next step is emergency coronary angiography (<2h) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). If the ECG shows other changes such as ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion suggesting NSTEMI or unstable angina, the patient would still need urgent angiography. However, the acute presentation with jugular distension elevates the risk and necessitates more immediate intervention. Therefore, emergency coronary angiography within 2 hours is the most appropriate next step. Troponin levels are important but will take time to result, and would not be first line. Angio-CT is more appropriate to investigate pulmonary embolism.",True

Reasoning: The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, dilated and tortuous veins. These are classic signs of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The patient's history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension is also a risk factor for CRVO. Retinopatia diabetica non proliferante presents with dot and blot hemorrhages, microaneurysms, and hard exudates. Occlusione venosa di branca would show sectoral retinal hemorrhages. Degenerazione maculare neovascolare legata all'età would likely show subretinal fluid or hemorrhage in the macula.

Reasoning: The patient is a 75-year-old with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, presenting with a sudden decrease in vision in the right eye. The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, tortuous and dilated veins, and optic disc edema. These findings are highly suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Diabetic retinopathy typically presents with microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, and exudates, which are not the predominant features here. Branch retinal vein occlusion would involve only a sector of the retina. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration typically shows subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, and choroidal neovascularization in the macula. Central serous retinopathy would present with a serous detachment of the macula. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is central retinal vein occlusion.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with retrosternal discomfort, nausea, and a history of diabetes mellitus, all of which are concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG is not entirely normal. While it doesn't show ST-segment elevation, there are subtle T-wave inversions/flattening that are concerning. Given the symptoms and risk factors, it's prudent to admit the patient to a monitored cardiac bed, repeat ECGs, and check troponin levels to rule out non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina. Starting aspirin alone and discharging the patient (option B) is not appropriate without further investigation. While coronary angiography might be necessary eventually (option C), it's not the immediate first step. Option D, observation in the ED, delays definitive diagnosis and management. Option E, investigating non-cardiac causes, might be relevant later if cardiac causes are ruled out, but it is not the immediate priority. The most appropriate immediate step is to rule out an acute cardiac event.",False,A,"IT0713, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest discomfort, nausea, and a history of diabetes, suggesting a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Qual è il trattamento iniziale più appropriato per questo paziente?",D,True,D,"IT0783, D
Reasoning: Giant cell tumors of bone are typically treated with curettage (svuotamento) followed by local adjuvants (such as phenol or cement) and bone grafting or cementation. This is the most appropriate initial treatment, preserving function and avoiding more radical procedures like resection or amputation unless necessary for aggressive or recurrent tumors. Radiotherapy is typically avoided due to the risk of secondary malignancy. Chemotherapy is not a standard treatment for giant cell tumors. Based on the X-ray and the patient's age, curettage and grafting/cementation seems the most reasonable first approach. Amputation is too drastic for the initial treatment.
The X-ray confirms significant bone damage at the wrist, but doesn't preclude a limb-sparing procedure such as curettage and bone grafting/cementation.
A, B and C involve either chemo and/or radiotherapy. These are not the initial recommended approach.

D is the only appropriate choice for this case.",True,D,"IT0783, D
Reasoning: The question describes a 38-year-old man with a growing swelling and pain in his left wrist for 8 months. He has been diagnosed with a giant cell tumor of bone (GCT). The most appropriate initial treatment for GCT of bone is curettage, application of local adjuvants, and bone grafting or cementation.

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a fracture through the proximal humeral physis (growth plate) in a 10 year old child. This is most likely a Salter-Harris type I or II fracture, representing a proximal humeral epiphyseal separation. A fracture of the clavicle would be a less likely diagnosis since the image seems to show the injury at the head of humerus.

Chondrosarcoma is highly unlikely at this age in the proximal humerus after an acute trauma.",False,D,"IT0784, D
Reasoning: The radiograph shows a separation at the proximal humeral epiphysis. Given the history of trauma in a 10-year-old child, the most likely diagnosis is a proximal humeral epiphyseal fracture (Salter-Harris type I or II), which is also referred to as epiphyseal detachment or separation. The other options are less likely given the age and history of trauma. A bone cyst is less likely related to acute trauma, Ewing's sarcoma is also less likely given the acute trauma.

Reasoning: The arthroscopic image (A) shows a meniscal tear with displacement, highly suggestive of a bucket-handle tear. The MRI (B) also supports this diagnosis, as it shows the displaced fragment of the meniscus. The limited range of motion and sensation of locking further support a meniscal injury. Other options are less likely given the imaging findings and clinical presentation.

Reasoning: The patient's symptoms (acute knee pain, swelling after a twisting injury following a jump, knee locking, and limited range of motion 20-90 degrees) are highly suggestive of a meniscal tear. The term ""blocco del ginocchio"" specifically points towards a meniscal issue. A bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus is a common type of meniscal tear that can cause these symptoms. While other injuries are possible, the constellation of findings strongly suggests a bucket-handle meniscal tear.

Reasoning: The description points to scabies (scabbia). Key indicators are: generalized itching that's worse at night, papules and excoriations due to scratching, and linear lesions (burrows) with a papule at one end, which is highly suggestive of the mite burrow. Pediculosis (lice) typically involves the head. Urticaria (hives) usually presents as wheals. Bullous pemphigoid involves blisters. Cutaneous leishmaniasis would not typically present with generalized itching and the described lesions.",True

Other options can be excluded because they don't display schistocytes.",True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on a peripheral blood smear is highly suggestive of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is characterized by the fragmentation of red blood cells as they pass through damaged or narrowed microvasculature. The other options are less likely. Drepanocytosis (sickle cell anemia) presents with sickle cells. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia does not typically present with schistocytes unless there is an underlying microangiopathy. Elliptocytosis shows elliptical red blood cells. Macro-ovalocytes are seen in megaloblastic anemia.",True
1,IT0908,Un paziente di 85 anni giunge all’ambulatorio di Endoscopia Digestiva per eseguire una esofagogastroduodenoscopia (EGDS) in seguito a riferita emissione di feci scure con riscontro agli esami ematochimici di anemia (Hb:8 g/dL) ipocromica microcitica. L’EGDS mostra in sede antrale il quadro riportato. Qual è la diagnosi endoscopica di quanto osservato?,A,True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and iron deficiency anemia. EGDS reveals an antral lesion. The image depicts an ulcer with a flat, adherent clot (Forrest IIc) within the ulcer base, indicating recent bleeding. Forrest IIc ulcers are characterized by a flat, adherent clot that is not actively bleeding at the time of endoscopy. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because the image does not show a polyp, active bleeding (Forrest I), a clean-based ulcer (Forrest III), or a diverticular formation.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The question describes an 85-year-old patient with anemia and dark stools, suggesting a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. The EGDS reveals a lesion in the antrum. The options provided relate to different endoscopic findings. Given that the patient presents with anemia and dark stools, a gastric ulcer is more likely than a polyp or diverticulum. The Forrest classification is used to categorize ulcers based on their bleeding potential. Forrest IIc indicates an ulcer base with a flat spot or clean base, which is consistent with the chronic presentation of the anemia. An ulcer classified as Forrest I would indicate active bleeding, and Forrest III indicates non-bleeding ulcer with a clean base. Therefore, based on the clinical context, option A is the most appropriate endoscopic diagnosis.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4 (anterior leads). This, along with the patient's symptoms (epigastric pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, bradycardia), suggests an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia are also common in STEMI. The ECG is not normal and does not show a right bundle branch block. Although pericarditis can cause chest pain, the ECG findings of ST elevation in anterior leads is more indicative of STEMI than pericarditis (which typically shows diffuse ST elevation and PR depression). NSTEMI is ruled out by the ST segment elevation on the ECG.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, anxiety, diaphoresis, bradycardia, and extrasystoles, along with nausea and vomiting. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicating an inferior wall STEMI. The leucocytosis and hyperglycemia are also consistent with acute myocardial infarction.",True

Come si definisce quest’ultima tecnica di trattamento?",E,True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The description mentions that an applicator loaded with iridium 192 sources is placed in the vagina and uterus. This implies that the radiation source is placed within a body cavity. This technique is defined as intracavitary brachytherapy. Interstitial brachytherapy would involve placing the source directly into the tumor tissue, and external beam radiotherapy does not involve placing a source inside the body. Radio-immunotherapy is a different technique, and intraoperative radiotherapy occurs during surgery. Therefore, intracavitary brachytherapy is the correct answer. The image also shows applicators placed within the vaginal and uterine cavity.",True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes a 56-year-old patient with inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix who is undergoing chemoradiotherapy. The radiotherapy involves irradiation of the pelvic region followed by the placement of an applicator loaded with iridium 192 sources in the vagina and uterus. This placement of radioactive sources within a body cavity (vagina and uterus) defines intracavitary brachytherapy. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.",True

Reasoning: The patient is hemodynamically stable (PA 110/65 mmHg) and the ECG shows supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to nodal reentry. Adenosine is the first-line treatment for stable SVT. While cardioversion is an option, it is generally reserved for unstable patients or those who do not respond to adenosine. Atropine would be used for bradycardia. Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic agonist and would increase the heart rate, which is contraindicated here. KCl would be used to treat hypokalemia, which is not indicated in this scenario.",True

Reasoning: The description mentions rapid growth, a rough surface, light brown color, multiple similar lesions on the chest and neck, and dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudocysts. These are classic features of pigmented seborrheic keratosis. While a prior melanoma history should raise suspicion, the dermatoscopic findings are more in line with seborrheic keratosis. The image supports this, showing typical features of seborrheic keratosis. The rapid growth suggests a high index of suspicion, but the dermatoscopic features push toward seborrheic keratosis.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description points towards seborrheic keratosis. Key features are: the patient's age, the presence of multiple lesions, the ""stuck-on"" appearance (described as ""nettamente aumentata dall’ultimo controllo, di circa 3 cm di diametro, rilevata, di colore marrone chiaro, ruvida al tatto""), and the dermatoscopic findings (sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee). These features are characteristic of seborrheic keratoses. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the current lesions don't show the typical features of melanoma. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma also don't fit the description. Dysplastic nevus usually appears as a single lesion, with irregular borders and atypical pigmentation.",True
1,IT1023,"Maschio di 40 anni, celiaco, si presenta all’osservazione con un’eruzione papulo-vescicolosa, simmetrica che si localizza preferenzialmente alle superfici estensorie degli arti.

Quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 40-year-old male with celiac disease presenting with a symmetric papulo-vesicular eruption predominantly on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, intense pruritus and burning sensation, negative Nikolski sign, IgA anti-transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, dermo-epidermal separation on skin biopsy, and granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence. All these findings are characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis, a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. The image shows papules and vesicles on the extensor surfaces of the feet, consistent with this diagnosis.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is strongly associated with celiac disease. The presence of IgA deposits in the dermal papillae is a key diagnostic feature. The other options are less likely given the specific findings:

*   Linear IgA bullous dermatosis usually presents with linear IgA deposits along the basement membrane zone.
*   Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by IgG autoantibodies against desmosomes and positive Nikolski sign.
*   Bullous scabies presents with vesicles and bullae in the setting of scabies infestation.
*   Bullous pemphigoid involves IgG autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes and a subepidermal blister.",True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The description points towards dermatitis herpetiformis. The key features are:
1. Celiac disease association.
2. Papulo-vesicular eruption on extensor surfaces.
3. Intense pruritus and burning.
4. IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies.
5. Dermo-epidermal separation with IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence. These are all classic findings for dermatitis herpetiformis.
Dermatosis a IgA lineare is a possibility but the IgA deposition pattern is more linear.
The other options are less likely given the clinical and histological findings.
Pemfigo volgare involves IgG antibodies, Nikolsky sign is usually positive, and the location is different. Scabbia bollosa would have scabies mites or their products found on microscopy. Pemfigoide bolloso is associated with IgG antibodies against the basement membrane and a different clinical presentation.",True

Reasoning: The spirometry results show that FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) and FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) are both reduced compared to the reference values (57% and 60% respectively). This indicates a reduction in the amount of air that the patient can forcefully exhale, suggesting a restrictive ventilatory defect. The FEV1/FVC ratio is 85%, which is above the lower limit of normal. If it was an obstructive defect, this ratio would be decreased. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a restrictive ventilatory syndrome. Options D and E are less likely based on the presented spirometry data. Option A can be immediately discarded given the reduced FVC. Option B is incorrect, because the dynamic volumes would be reduced.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: From the image, FVC is 61% which is lower than normal. FEV1 is 55% which is also lower than normal. FEV1/FVC is 67%, which is normal or increased. These results indicate a restrictive ventilatory defect. Therefore, the most probable ventilatory syndrome is a restrictive type.",True

Viene eseguito un ECG il cui tracciato è riportato qui di seguito. Quale tra i seguenti è il trattamento più adeguato?",C,True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (third-degree AV block). The P waves are present but not related to the QRS complexes, which have a slow rate. The patient's symptoms (weakness, headache, and dizziness) are likely due to the slow heart rate. The most appropriate treatment for a complete heart block with symptoms is the implantation of a pacemaker. Cardioversion and defibrillation are not indicated, as the rhythm is not a tachyarrhythmia. Midodrine is used for hypotension and would not address the underlying bradycardia. Stopping the ACE inhibitor is unlikely to improve the conduction block.",True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG tracing shows a complete heart block (AV block of the third degree). The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness). The appropriate treatment for symptomatic complete heart block is a pacemaker implantation. Cardioversion is used for unstable tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is used for orthostatic hypotension. Stopping the ACE inhibitor might help if the hypotension is medication-induced, but the heart block needs to be addressed.

1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: In a case-control study, we calculate the Odds Ratio (OR) to estimate the association between a risk factor and the disease. The formula for OR is (a*d)/(b*c), where:
- a = number of cases exposed (250)
- b = number of cases unexposed (100)
- c = number of controls exposed (150)
- d = number of controls unexposed (400)
Therefore, the correct OR calculation is (250*400) / (100*150). Option E gives the inverse of this value, but it's closest to the correct formula after inverting it. However, upon further examination and understanding the context of the available options, the question intended to represent:

Disease +   Disease -
Exposed    a = 250     b = 150
Unexposed  c = 100     d = 400

Odds Ratio = (a/c) / (b/d) = (a*d) / (b*c) = (250*400) / (100 * 150). None of the options match this exactly. Upon close inspection, it looks like rows are unintentionally swapped between columns when typing the options. The correct one according to the table should be E, or (150*400) / (250*100)
, assuming the rows are swapped between columns. Apologies for the incorrect initial response. Edited to have correct response.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between disease and risk factor in a case-control study. In case-control studies, we use the Odds Ratio to estimate this association. The Odds Ratio is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of cases with the risk factor, 'b' is the number of cases without the risk factor, 'c' is the number of controls with the risk factor, and 'd' is the number of controls without the risk factor. From the implied table, we can assume:

- a = 150 (number of cases *with* risk factor)
- b = 250 (number of cases *without* risk factor)
- c = 100 (number of controls *with* risk factor)
- d = 400 (number of controls *without* risk factor)

Therefore, the correct Odds Ratio calculation is (150*400)/(250*100).",False

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a filling defect in the pulmonary artery, suggesting a pulmonary embolism. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain that worsens with breathing also support this diagnosis. The chest x-ray shows some lung abnormalities but is not specific enough to confirm PE. The CT scan is more definitive.
While aortic dissection can cause chest pain, the CT scan does not show the characteristic double lumen or intimal flap.
Acute myocarditis, pericardial effusion and acute myocardial infarction, although possible causes of chest pain and dyspnea, are less likely based on the imaging findings. The CT scan is more suggestive of pulmonary embolism.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The clinical presentation (dyspnea and chest pain worsening with breathing) and the CT scan with contrast (mdc) suggest pulmonary embolism. The image shows a filling defect in the pulmonary artery, indicative of a thrombus. While other options could present with chest pain, the combination of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and the imaging findings specifically point to pulmonary embolism.",False
