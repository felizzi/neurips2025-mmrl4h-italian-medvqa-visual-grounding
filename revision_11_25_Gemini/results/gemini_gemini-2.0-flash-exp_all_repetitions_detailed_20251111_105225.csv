1,IT0007,Il paziente presenterà probabilmente:,C,True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V4, suggesting an anterior wall myocardial infarction. This is most likely caused by an occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.",True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning:  The image is completely white, implying no information is provided. Therefore, I must answer based only on the question text ""Il paziente presenterà probabilmente:"" which translates to ""The patient will probably present:"". Without clinical context or findings, it's impossible to definitively determine the correct answer. However, considering the options related to cardiac events, occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) is generally more common and often presents with more significant symptoms than occlusion of the circumflex or right coronary artery (implied by ""discendente posteriore""). Vagal activation symptoms are less likely as a primary presenting feature of a cardiac event. Pneumothorax is unrelated to cardiac events without further information. Therefore, occlusion of the LAD is the most probable answer given lack of more details.",True

Reasoning: The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of ischemic stroke and diabetes, undergoing polypharmacy. He presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear-fluid-filled bullae accompanied by intense pruritus. The image shows tense bullae on an erythematous base, consistent with bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is more common in elderly patients. Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement. Herpes zoster presents with a dermatomal distribution of vesicles. Contact dermatitis would have a more localized and often eczematous appearance. Bullous impetigo usually affects children and presents with superficial bullae.
.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy. He presents with widespread urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled blisters and intense itching. These clinical features are highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, a common autoimmune blistering disease in the elderly.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **B) Pemphigus vulgaris:** Typically presents with flaccid bullae that easily rupture, leading to painful erosions, and often involves mucosal surfaces.
*   **C) Herpes Zoster:** Usually presents with a painful, unilateral vesicular rash along a dermatome.
*   **D) Contact dermatitis:** Usually caused by a specific allergen or irritant and typically presents with localized eczematous changes.
*   **E) Bullous impetigo:** Usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and presents with superficial blisters that easily rupture, forming honey-colored crusts. Common in children.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae that are intensely pruritic. This clinical picture suggests a blistering disease. Bullous pemphigoid is a common bullous disease in the elderly. The correct diagnostic approach is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to detect antibodies against the basement membrane. Option A is related to celiac disease. Option C (dermatoscopy) is not the first choice. Option D (Tzank smear) is more appropriate for herpes infections. Option E is more related to pemphigus diseases. Given the patient's age and clinical presentation, bullous pemphigoid is the most likely diagnosis, making option B the most appropriate answer. The image confirms the presence of bullae on an erythematous base. Therefore, the immunofluorescence staining is aimed to identify the site of Ig deposition in the basement membrane zone.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense blisters, which are intensely pruritic. This clinical picture is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to look for antibodies against the basement membrane. Option A is related to celiac disease, which is less likely given the skin presentation. Option C (Dermatoscopy) might be useful for characterizing the blister morphology but doesn't provide definitive diagnosis. Option D (Tzank smear) is more useful for diagnosing herpes infections. Option E (antibodies anti-desmogleina 1 and 3) is associated with pemphigus vulgaris/foliaceus, which typically doesn't present with urticarial plaques.",True
1,IT0053,"[In uno studio caso-controllo per comprendere l'eziologia del cancro dell'esofago, 870 casi e 902 controlli sono stati indagati per quanto concerne il consumo abituale di superalcolici.] L'associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio può essere quantificata calcolando:",C,True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question explicitly states this is a case-control study. In case-control studies, the appropriate measure of association is the Odds Ratio (OR). The formula for OR is (a*d)/(b*c), where:
- a = number of cases with exposure (656)
- b = number of cases without exposure (214)
- c = number of controls with exposure (516)
- d = number of controls without exposure (386)

Therefore, the correct calculation is OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). Option C accurately reflects this calculation. Option A and E calculate the risk difference. Option B calculates the risk ratio. Option D is incorrect.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between a risk factor and a disease. The OR is calculated as (odds of exposure among cases) / (odds of exposure among controls). This translates to (number of cases with exposure / number of cases without exposure) / (number of controls with exposure / number of controls without exposure), which simplifies to (cases with exposure * controls without exposure) / (cases without exposure * controls with exposure). The numbers provided in option C, (656 * 386) / (516 * 214), correctly represents the OR calculation for a case-control study using the provided numbers. Options A, B, D, and E represent different measures of association or incorrect calculations. Option A and E calculate risk difference (RA), which is not appropriate for a case-control study. Option B calculates the relative risk (RR), which is more suitable for cohort studies and not directly applicable to case-control studies without adjusting for the incidence. Option D is incomplete and doesn't represent the proper OR calculation.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and quicker to conduct than other types of epidemiological studies, particularly cohort studies. This is because they start with existing cases of a disease and then look back in time to identify potential risk factors. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because case-control studies are not designed to directly measure incidence or prevalence. Incidence and prevalence are measures that are best estimated through longitudinal studies such as cohort studies. The image provided confirms the numbers used in the case control study design.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally cheaper and faster to conduct compared to cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. They start with cases (individuals with the disease) and controls (individuals without the disease) and look back in time to determine exposure. Because the outcome has already occurred, the study can be completed relatively quickly and with less cost. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because case-control studies do not directly measure incidence or prevalence. They are primarily used to investigate associations between exposures and outcomes by calculating odds ratios.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6. ST elevation in these leads is characteristic of an anterior STEMI. The other options are incorrect because the ECG does not show changes consistent with pericarditis (diffuse ST elevation), inferior STEMI (ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF), or anterolateral STEMI. Given the patient's presentation and ECG findings, an anterior STEMI is the most likely diagnosis. The patient is also hypotensive and bradycardic, which can be due to an anterior infarct. Although a previous anterior infarct is a possibility, the current ECG showing ST elevation makes this a more likely STEMI.",False,C,"IT0063, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, which is indicative of an inferior STEMI. The patient's symptoms of epigastric pain, along with hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardia (57/min), also point towards an inferior myocardial infarction, potentially involving the right ventricle. Antero-lateral or anterior STEMI would present with ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I and aVL. Pericarditis would show widespread ST elevation. The absence of Q waves makes a prior infarct less likely.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and the ECG shows ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF). This indicates an acute inferior myocardial infarction. Given the impending transfer to the cardiac catheterization lab for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), antiplatelet therapy is crucial. Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor used as part of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) along with aspirin in acute coronary syndromes, including STEMI. Nitroprussiate of sodium will further lower the blood pressure, contraindicated in this scenario. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker, that will further lower the heart rate and is contraindicated given the bradycardia and possible inferior MI. Warfarin is a Vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant and is not indicated in acute MI. Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is contraindicated in the acute setting due to the hypotension. Therefore, Ticagrelor is the most appropriate initial treatment.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient is presenting with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), and bradycardia (57/min). The ECG is also shown. Given the epigastric pain onset in the last 6 hours, and the patient's risk factors (smoker, hypertensive), a possible acute coronary syndrome needs to be considered. The patient's blood pressure is low, making nitroprusside (A) and enalapril (E) unsuitable due to their hypotensive effects. Diltiazem (B) is a calcium channel blocker that slows heart rate and lowers blood pressure, which is contraindicated given the patient's bradycardia and hypotension. Warfarin (C) is an anticoagulant that is not suitable as an initial treatment for acute coronary syndrome. Ticagrelor (D) is a P2Y12 inhibitor antiplatelet agent, that should be started as early as possible when acute coronary syndrome is considered.",True

Reasoning: The patient is hypotensive and bradycardic. The ECG shows sinus bradycardia, and significant ST elevation in inferior leads II, III and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in aVL and V1-V3. This indicates an inferior wall MI, most likely due to occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The RCA supplies the inferior wall of the heart. The presence of hypotension and bradycardia raises the suspicion for RV involvement. Therefore, the most likely culprit lesion is the right coronary artery.",True,A,"IT0065, A
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which indicates an inferior wall myocardial infarction. This is most commonly caused by an occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's bradycardia (FC 57/min) can also be caused by an occlusion of the RCA, which supplies the SA and AV nodes in a significant number of people.",True
1,IT0095,"[Un ragazzo di 23 anni è vittima di un incidente automobilistico (moto contro auto). All'arrivo dei soccorsi viene riferito il seguente esame obiettivo neurologico: il paziente giace a occhi chiusi, non li apre né allo stimolo verbale né allo stimolo doloroso, eloquio assente, alla stimolazione algica il paziente tende ad allontanare gli arti dalla fonte dello stimolo. Presenta anisocoria per destra > sinistra.] Il paziente viene trasferito presso il Pronto Soccorso dove viene sottoposto a una TC cerebrale. Quale reperto è verosimilmente apprezzabile alla TC?",C,True,D,"IT0095, D
Reasoning: The patient has a history of trauma (motorcycle vs. car accident) and presents with neurological deficits indicating a severe head injury (GCS is likely low). The anisocoria (right > left) suggests a possible mass effect compressing the third cranial nerve. The CT scan shows a hyperdense, crescent-shaped lesion that is consistent with an acute subdural hematoma. An acute subdural hematoma is a common finding after traumatic brain injury and can cause mass effect and neurological deterioration.
A) Intraparenchymal hematoma would appear as a more localized area of increased density within the brain parenchyma.
B) Chronic subdural hematoma is typically hypodense or isodense on CT.
C) Epidural hematoma is often lens-shaped or biconvex.
E) Subgaleal hematoma is superficial to the skull and would not cause the same mass effect on the brain.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's neurological examination suggests a severe head injury. The description indicates that the patient doesn't open eyes with verbal or pain stimulus, is not speaking, reacts to pain by withdrawing limbs and presents anisocoria (right > left).
Considering the accident (motorcycle vs car) and the anisocoria, which usually indicates a brain lesion compressing the third cranial nerve, an intraparenchymal hematoma is most likely to be seen on the CT scan.
- Epidural hematomas are usually associated with skull fractures and are less likely to cause anisocoria so quickly unless massive.
- Subdural hematomas (acute) are also possible, but less likely to cause anisocoria as early as described. Chronic subdural hematomas usually doesn't present immediately after the trauma.
- Subgaleal hematomas are external to the skull and wouldn't explain anisocoria.
Therefore, an intraparenchymal hematoma is the most plausible finding.",False

Reasoning: The image shows a side view of the lumbar spine, clearly demonstrating the vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and spinal canal in a vertical plane. This corresponds to a sagittal plane. The image is not showing an oblique view. So the answer should be ""Piano sagittale puro"".",True,A,"IT0130, A
Reasoning: The image shows a lateral view of the lumbar spine, which is a sagittal plane. We can see the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other from the side. Options D and E describe oblique sagittal planes, which are used to examine specific structures like pedicles or neural foramina in more detail. While this image could technically be used for that purpose, it isn't the primary, distinguishing view of the pedicles or foramen, rather just a good lateral view of the spine. Also, based on the shape and orientation of the vertebrae, it is a pure sagittal plane.",True

Reasoning: The patient has a lumbar MRI showing a possible bone metastasis, and they are experiencing lower back pain unresponsive to anti-inflammatory medications. The question asks for the most appropriate test to identify bone metastases. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is the most sensitive method for detecting bone metastases, as it images the entire skeleton and identifies areas of increased bone turnover, which is a hallmark of metastatic disease. CT scans can be used, but the bone scan is better for overall screening. The lumbar spine has already been visualized via MRI, and the more appropriate choice is the bone scan, because it is more sensitive and images the entire skeleton.
Options B, C and E are not the best choice because the bone scan shows all skeleton, and if bone metastasis are in other bones, the CT would not detect them. The ultrasound exam is only useful for superficial bones, so it's not useful in this case.
The image is an MRI.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question describes a patient with lower back pain and a probable bone metastasis found on an MRI of the lumbar spine. The question asks which test is most appropriate to identify the presence of bone metastases. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is a sensitive imaging technique used to detect areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic disease. While CT scans can also detect bone metastases, a bone scan is generally more sensitive for detecting early or subtle lesions. Therefore, a bone scan is the most appropriate choice.",True

Reasoning: The endoscopic image shows a loss of the normal villous architecture of the small intestine, resulting in a flattened appearance. This is indicative of mucosal atrophy, which is often associated with malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease. There are no clear signs of fistulas, abscesses, neoformation, bleeding or ulcers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the presence of mucosal atrophy.",True,B,"IT0136, B
Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old woman with abdominal pain and postprandial diarrhea, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy is performed with suspicion of malabsorption. The image shows villous atrophy of the mucosa, which is a characteristic finding in malabsorption syndromes like celiac disease. Therefore, atrophy of the mucosa (B) is the most likely finding.",True

Reasoning: The radiograph shows multiple well-defined, round opacities distributed throughout both lung fields. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases. The other options are less likely given the appearance of these well-defined masses.
A) Miliary tuberculosis would typically show smaller, more diffuse nodules.
C) Multifocal pneumonia would likely have a more patchy, less well-defined appearance.
D) Atelectasis would typically present as areas of increased density and volume loss.
E) The shadows are not in the typical location for EKG electrodes. The location and morphology of the round opacities strongly favors metastases.",True,B,"IT0200, B
Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows multiple, well-defined, round opacities scattered throughout both lung fields. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases. Tuberculous lesions are typically smaller and have different characteristics. Pneumonia would likely be more diffuse.

Reasoning: The ECG shows a rapid, wide QRS complex tachycardia with varying morphology. This is indicative of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, specifically Torsades de Pointes, given the twisting of the QRS complexes around the isoelectric baseline.
The rhythm is clearly not Supraventricular tachycardia because the QRS complexes are wide. Also, the rhythm is irregular and does not have a uniform QRS morphology, which rules out Monomorphic Ventricular Tachycardia. While the heart rate is very fast, the complexes have an undulating morphology making it unlikely to be Atrial Fibrillation.

Reasoning: The image shows a cadaver with signs of decomposition including skin discoloration, bloating, and the presence of maggots. Given that the rigor mortis has completely resolved, and considering the advanced state of decomposition visible in the image, a timeframe of approximately 3-5 days is the most plausible estimate. The presence of maggots indicates that some time has passed since the death, certainly more than 24 hours. A month or several months are too long considering the stage of decomposition is not skeletal yet. The time of year in Sicily (August) also favors a faster decomposition rate.",True,A,"IT0229, A
Reasoning: The question describes a scenario where a forensic doctor is called to a crime scene in Sicily on August 13, 2011, at 8 PM. The body is found inside a residence, and due to a strong smell, the windows have been opened. The image and the text specifies a complete resolution of the rigor mortis. Rigor mortis typically resolves after 24 to 36 hours. Based on this information, the most plausible time frame after death would be a few days (3-5 days). The rigor mortis has resolved.

Si prende visione della TC encefalo senza mezzo di contrasto che nel frattempo è stata richiesta (si veda immagine).] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",C,True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left fronto-parietal region, which is indicative of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient's symptoms (sudden onset of headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis) and history of hypertension and cirrhosis are also consistent with a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Option A is incorrect because an epidural hematoma typically presents with a lucid interval.
Option B is less likely because the CT shows the hemorrhage in the frontal and parietal region, not the parieto-occipital region, and it's not a subdural hematoma shape.
Option D is unlikely because ischemic stroke does not typically present with headache and vomiting initially. Also, the CT shows a hyperdense area, while an ischemic stroke would initially appear hypodense.
Option E is unlikely because subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with a severe headache (thunderclap headache) and the CT scan does not show the characteristic findings of a subarachnoid hemorrhage such as blood in the basal cisterns.",True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis. The CT scan (without contrast) shows a hyperdense lesion in the left fronto-parietal region, suggestive of a hemorrhage. Given the patient's history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis, a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage is the most likely diagnosis. The symptoms (aphasia and right hemiparesis) correlate with the location of the hemorrhage on the left side of the brain. Epidural hematoma would typically be associated with trauma. Subdural hematoma can be chronic and insidious, but the presentation described is more typical for acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Ischemic stroke is possible, but the CT scan appearance is more consistent with hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage would have a different CT appearance (blood in the subarachnoid space).",True

Reasoning: The clinical presentation (progressive weakness in the right arm and expressive aphasia) suggests a lesion in the left frontal lobe (due to contralateral motor deficit and language area involvement). The MRI findings describe an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal region with homogeneous contrast enhancement and dural tail, highly suggestive of a meningioma. Specifically, the description matches a meningioma of the convexity. Option A correctly identifies a meningioma. The tumor appears to be located on the right side based on the image. However, the symptomatology (right arm weakness and aphasia) strongly indicates a left-sided pathology, thus the laterality in the answer A is incorrect. However, among the answers provided, meningioma is the most probable diagnosis. All other options are less likely given the described features (gliomas usually are intra-axial, metastases less likely to be solitary and with dural tail, hematoma and hemorrhage are usually acute events, with different signal characteristics on MRI).
The question does not have consistent laterality information. Patient presents with symptoms pointing to the left hemisphere, while the tumor is described to be on the right in the question stem and the image. Since the presence of the extra-axial homogeneously enhancing lesion with dural tail is characteristic of meningioma, I selected A.

In conclusion, while the given information about laterality is inconsistent, meningioma is the most likely diagnosis based on the typical features of the lesion described.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description points to a lesion in the right frontal area causing weakness in the right arm and expressive aphasia, and the MRI shows a lesion that is likely extra-axial, enhances with contrast, and has a dural tail. This description is very characteristic of a meningioma. The lesion being frontal, it's likely originating from the right frontal convexity rather than the left. However, the symptoms are predominantly on the RIGHT side and the lesion, according to the text and image, is on the RIGHT. The explanation for the weakness being contralateral is because of the frontal lesion's pressure. Therefore, the description refers to the MOST likely diagnosis of a right frontal convexity meningioma. Option A is the closest one, though incorrect laterality is present.

Specifically, option A is slightly incorrect because the meningioma is on the RIGHT.

B) Glioma would not typically be described as extra-axial or have a dural tail, although high-grade gliomas may enhance with contrast.
C) Metastases can occur, but the dural tail makes a meningioma more likely.
D) Subdural hematomas are usually associated with trauma and do not typically enhance in this pattern.
E) Hemorrhages usually have a different appearance on MRI and wouldn't be described as extra-axial or have a dural tail. Also, the description emphasizes the presence of a lesion.",True

Topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are generally not indicated for this condition.",True,E,"IT0311, E
Reasoning: The question describes pinkish-brown papules in the perineal region that sometimes coalesce into plaques, which are asymptomatic. This clinical presentation is suggestive of condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, surgical removal, and imiquimod are all treatments indicated for genital warts. Topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used for genital warts and would be ineffective or even harmful in this context. Therefore, the answer is E.",True

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense (bright) collection along the left cerebral convexity, which is consistent with an acute subdural hematoma. The hematoma is causing mass effect and midline shift. The shape, density, and location strongly suggest subdural rather than epidural, intraparenchymal, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea, hypotension, and hypoxia, which are common symptoms of pulmonary embolism. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and possible S1Q3T3 pattern (difficult to definitively confirm from the image), which are suggestive of pulmonary embolism. The recent prostatectomy is a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to pulmonary embolism. Other options such as Brugada syndrome and aortic dissection are less likely given the clinical context and ECG findings.
The ECG doesn't show clear signs of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure in hypertensive cardiomyopathy, or anemia in post-operative period. Brugada is typically characterized by ST segment elevation in V1-V3.
Based on clinical data and ECG findings, pulmonary embolism is the most probable diagnosis.
There are no obvious signs of left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG and no obvious ST elevation that would be consistent with the brugada syndrome.
Anemia is improbable cause of the clinical symptoms.
Aortic dissection typically results in different ECG findings depending on which artery is affected, but most likely will show ischemia.

He is also on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, increasing the risk of bleeding. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense compared to the brain parenchyma. This appearance is characteristic of a chronic subdural hematoma. The time frame (4 weeks post-trauma) and the iso-hypodense appearance on CT are key indicators. Acute subdural hematomas would typically appear hyperdense. Epidural hematomas usually have a lens shape.

Reasoning: The patient's history includes a head trauma 4 weeks prior, symptoms that developed over days, and a CT scan showing a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense relative to the brain parenchyma. These findings are consistent with a chronic subdural hematoma. The gradual development of symptoms after a previous trauma suggests chronicity. The CT description aligns with the appearance of chronic blood collections.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage would appear as a more localized area of blood within the brain tissue itself. Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with sudden onset of severe headache.

The ECG (although not provided in detail), is mentioned suggesting it must have shown findings indicating a possible ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or other acute coronary event. Given the high suspicion for ACS and the potential for STEMI, the next step should be emergent coronary angiography (<2 hours) to identify and treat the coronary occlusion.

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a fracture through the proximal humeral physis (growth plate). This is common in children and adolescents after a fall or trauma. The other options are less likely given the patient's age, the acute onset of pain after trauma, and the radiographic findings. A juvenile bone cyst would typically be more lucent. A clavicle fracture would be located in the clavicle. Sarcoma of Ewing is less likely given the history of trauma.

Reasoning: The arthroscopic image (A) shows a characteristic ""bucket-handle"" tear of the medial meniscus. The MRI (B) also supports this diagnosis by showing a displaced meniscal fragment. Knee locking and limited range of motion (20-90 degrees) are consistent with a bucket-handle meniscal tear. Therefore, a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus is the most likely diagnosis.",True,E,"IT0785, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with acute knee pain, swelling, and a sensation of locking after a twisting injury. The limited range of motion (20-90 degrees) strongly suggests a mechanical block within the knee joint. The arthroscopic image (Figure A) is not visible, but the history of locking and the limited range of motion points towards a meniscal tear, specifically a ""bucket-handle"" tear which can cause a mechanical block. While the MRI image (Figure B) is also not visible, a bucket-handle tear should be visible on an MRI. Osteochondral lesions can cause pain and swelling, but usually don't cause locking. ACL tears cause instability, not necessarily a mechanical block. Tibial plateau fractures would cause more significant pain and inability to weight-bear. PCL injuries are less common with a mechanism such as described and are less likely to cause locking. Therefore, a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus is the most probable diagnosis.",True

The esophagography shows a dilated esophagus with a ""bird's beak"" appearance at the lower esophageal sphincter, which is characteristic of achalasia. Acalasia is a motility disorder characterized by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and the absence of esophageal peristalsis. GIST would likely present as a mass on endoscopy. Hiatal hernia might be seen on imaging, but the bird's beak appearance is more indicative of achalasia. GERD would not typically cause such severe dysphagia or the specific radiographic finding.

The chest X-ray shows a large area of hyperlucency on the left side with a visible visceral pleura line, consistent with a large pneumothorax. Given the clinical presentation, blood gas results, and radiographic findings, a massive left pneumothorax requiring urgent chest tube drainage is the most likely diagnosis.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with a maculopapular morbilliform eruption, facial edema, intense pruritus, and fever, all of which developed after starting allopurinol. Lab findings show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver and pancreatic enzymes. This clinical picture aligns best with Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). The time frame after drug initiation is also consistent with DRESS. The image also displays facial edema. SDRIFE typically presents with intertriginous involvement, which isn't mentioned. Nicolau's dermatitus is related to drug injection. AGEP involves pustules, not papules, and Sézary syndrome is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Therefore, DRESS is the most likely diagnosis.",True,C,"IT0891, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with a morbilliform maculopapular eruption, facial edema, pruritus, fever, and a history of starting allopurinol treatment three weeks prior. The blood tests show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver enzymes (transaminases), lipase, and amylase. This constellation of symptoms, especially the eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and systemic involvement (elevated enzymes), strongly suggests Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).

Here's why the other options are less likely:
*   **A) Symmetrical Drug-Related Intertriginous and Flexural Exanthema (SDRIFE):** SDRIFE typically involves the intertriginous areas and flexural folds, which is not the primary description here (""diffuse maculopapular eruption""). While pruritus can be present, systemic symptoms like fever and elevated liver enzymes are not characteristic.
*   **B) Dermatite livedoide di Nicolau:** Dermatite livedoide di Nicolau is a localized reaction to intramuscular injection, which does not fit the patient's diffuse rash and medication history.
*   **D) Acute Generalized Esantematic Pustolosis (AGEP):** AGEP is characterized by numerous small, non-follicular pustules on an erythematous base, not a maculopapular eruption. Also, eosinophilia is less pronounced in AGEP compared to DRESS.
*   **E) Sindrome di Sezary:** Sezary syndrome is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, characterized by erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and circulating Sezary cells, which is not consistent with the described presentation and laboratory findings. The atypical lymphocytes described in the problem could be circulating neoplastic T-cells, however without more information on the morphology and immunophenotype, the history of allopurinol introduction makes DRESS more likely.",True

Reasoning: The image shows schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells). Schistocytes are characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), which is caused by small blood vessel pathology. Therefore, the answer is microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
Drepanocytosis shows sickle cells. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia shows spherocytes. Elliptocytosis presents with elliptical cells. Macro-ovalocytosis presents with large ovalocytes.",True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The question mentions schistocytes on a peripheral blood smear.

L’EGDS mostra in sede antrale il quadro riportato. Qual è la diagnosi endoscopica di quanto osservato?,A,True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and anemia, suggesting a bleeding source in the upper GI tract. The EGDS reveals a lesion in the antrum. The Forrest classification is used to describe the endoscopic appearance of peptic ulcers and predict the risk of rebleeding. Forrest IIc describes a flat spot with an adherent clot. The image shows a flat spot at the antrum of the stomach that could be an ulcer base with some spots of recent bleeding. Therefore the diagnosis is Ulcera gastrica antrale tipo Forrest IIc. Forrest I would be active spurting/oozing of blood and Forrest III would be clean ulcer base. A hyperplastic polyp would have a different morphology. Diverticula are generally not found at the antrum.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and anemia, suggesting a bleeding lesion. The image shows an antral ulcer with a dark spot, which could represent a covered vessel or a clot, consistent with Forrest IIc classification. Forrest IIc ulcers have a flat spot, indicative of recent bleeding. Other options like Forrest I (active spurting) or Forrest III (clean base) do not fit the description.

Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, sweating, bradycardia and extrasystoles. The ECG shows ST elevation in V1-V4, indicating an anterior STEMI. Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia are also consistent with this diagnosis. While awaiting the results of specific enzymes, the ECG strongly supports the STEMI diagnosis.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in multiple leads (specifically, I, aVL, V2-V6). This, combined with the patient's symptoms (epigastric pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting), points strongly towards a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The other options are less likely given the ECG findings: Pericarditis can cause ST elevation but typically has more diffuse ST elevation and PR depression, which are not apparent here. Right bundle branch block would not cause ST elevation. An ECG within normal limits is ruled out by the obvious ST elevation. NSTEMI is ruled out because it does not feature ST elevation.",True

Reasoning: The question specifies that the ECG shows supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to nodal re-entry. The patient is hemodynamically stable (PA 110/65 mmHg, SpO2 99%). The first-line treatment for stable SVT is adenosine, which can interrupt the re-entry circuit in the AV node. Atropine is used for bradycardia.

Reasoning: The patient is presenting with a stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). According to treatment guidelines for SVT, adenosine is the first-line pharmacological treatment to attempt to terminate the arrhythmia. Atropine would be used for bradycardia. Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic agonist and would increase the heart rate, which is contraindicated here. KCl is used to treat hypokalemia. Cardioversion is generally reserved for unstable patients with SVT. Therefore, adenosine is the most appropriate initial intervention.",True

Reasoning: The description, including ""sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee"" (comedo-like follicular openings and corneal pseudo-cysts), is characteristic of seborrheic keratosis. The pigmented aspect reinforces this diagnosis. The image supports this too. Considering the rapid growth from the last checkup, although concerning, is also possible with these lesions. Other options are less likely. Melanoma is less probable due to the presence of comedo-like openings, and basal cell carcinoma typically presents differently. Dysplastic nevi are usually smaller and lack these specific dermatoscopic features. Squamous cell carcinoma generally presents with a different morphology. Therefore, seborrheic keratosis is the most probable diagnosis.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description indicates a rapidly growing, raised, light brown lesion with a rough texture. The dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudo-horn cysts strongly suggest seborrheic keratosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the dermatoscopic features are more indicative of seborrheic keratosis. Basal cell carcinoma is less likely given the description of comedo-like openings.

Reasoning: The clinical presentation of papulo-vesicular eruption symmetrically located on extensor surfaces of limbs, intense pruritus and burning sensation, along with IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies in a celiac patient, and granular IgA deposits at the dermal papillae tips on direct immunofluorescence strongly suggests Dermatitis Herpetiformis. The absence of Nikolski's sign further supports this diagnosis. Dermatosis a IgA lineare usually presents with a linear deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by intraepidermal blisters and antibodies against desmoglein 3 and/or 1. Scabies bollosa would be characterized by burrows and vesicles. Bullous pemphigoid typically exhibits IgG antibodies to the basement membrane and has a different presentation. The image of the lesions also supports the diagnosis of Dermatitis Herpetiformis.",True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The description points strongly towards Dermatitis Herpetiformis. The key features are:
- The patient is celiac.
- The rash is papulo-vesicular, symmetrical, and located on extensor surfaces.
- Intense pruritus and burning sensation.
- IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are present.
- Skin biopsy shows dermo-epidermal separation.
- Direct immunofluorescence shows granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae.
These are all characteristic findings of Dermatitis Herpetiformis.

The other options are less likely:
- IgA linear dermatosis: While it also involves IgA, the deposition pattern is linear, not granular.
- Pemphigus vulgaris: It's characterized by IgG antibodies against desmosomes, positive Nikolsky sign, and mucosal involvement, which are not present in this case.
- Bullous scabies: It's related to scabies infestation, no mention about it.
- Bullous Pemphigoid: It involves IgG antibodies against the basement membrane, and a linear pattern on immunofluorescence, which are not the same as the case.",True
1,IT1044,"Una signora di 67 anni con storia di dispnea da sforzo, mai indagata in precedenza e mai sottoposta ad intervento chirurgico toracico, esegue spirometria. Sulla base dei risultati di seguito riportati quale sindrome disventilatoria è più probabile tra le seguenti?",C,True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The spirometry results show that the FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) and FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) are both reduced significantly, compared to the reference values (%Rif values of 57 and 60, respectively). Also, the TLC is markedly reduced (43% Rif). The FEV1/FVC ratio is 78, which is within normal limits. Reduced FVC and FEV1 with a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio are suggestive of a restrictive ventilatory defect. Therefore, a restrictive ventilatory syndrome is the most probable diagnosis. There is no evidence of obstruction (reduced FEV1/FVC) or bronchodilator responsiveness.
The volumes polmonari section (Total Lung Capacity, TLC=43%; Vital Capacity VC=55%; Functional Residual Capacity FRC=43%; Residual Volume RV=23%) also suggests a restrictive pattern.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The question describes a 67-year-old woman with dyspnea on exertion who undergoes spirometry. We need to determine the most likely type of ventilatory defect based on the (unspecified) spirometry results. However, we can deduce the answer based on the other information provided. The key here is ""dispnea da sforzo"", which translates to ""dyspnea on exertion"". This symptom is more commonly associated with restrictive lung diseases where the lungs are unable to fully expand (reducing the total lung capacity). Option C, ""Sindrome disventilatoria di tipo restrittivo"", directly reflects this condition. While obstructive lung diseases can also cause dyspnea, it's not the most characteristic symptom of restrictive lung disease. Option A can be easily discarded, as her medical history suggests a disventilatory problem. Option B would not explain dyspnea. Option D describes a specific type of obstructive ventilatory defect. Option E does not describe the spirometry results, it's a potential response to a different test.",True

Viene eseguito un ECG il cui tracciato è riportato qui di seguito. Quale tra i seguenti è il trattamento più adeguato?",C,True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete AV block (third-degree heart block). There is no relationship between the P waves and the QRS complexes. The QRS complexes are wide, suggesting a ventricular escape rhythm. The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness). The most appropriate treatment is a pacemaker implantation. Cardioversion is not indicated because there is no tachyarrhythmia. Midodrine is used to treat hypotension. Stopping the ACE inhibitor is not appropriate as the primary treatment for the AV block. Defibrillation is used in ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (third-degree AV block). The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness), indicating a need for intervention. A pacemaker is the definitive treatment for complete heart block. Cardioversion is for unstable tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is for orthostatic hypotension. Stopping the ACE inhibitor might lower blood pressure but doesn't address the underlying heart block. Defibrillation is for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",True
1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning:
The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between disease and risk factor in a case-control study. Case-control studies use Odds Ratio (OR) to estimate the association.
The OR is calculated as (exposed with disease * unexposed without disease) / (exposed without disease * unexposed with disease).

Based on the table:
- Exposed with disease = 250
- Unexposed without disease = 400
- Exposed without disease = 150
- Unexposed with disease = 100

OR = (250 * 400) / (150 * 100)
Option E gives (150*400) / (250*100) which is the reciprocal of OR and NOT the correct OR calculation. However, option D is OR = (250 * 400) / (150 * 100), but swapped numerator and denominator of option E. Option E, upon correcting the flipped numerator and denominator, represents correct calculation.

Therefore, Option E is the correct answer for calculating the Odds Ratio: (150 * 400) / (250 * 100).
However, based on the extracted table, the Odds Ratio should be calculated as (250 * 400) / (150 * 100) which is given by **option D**

Final Answer: The final answer is D
IT1100, D
Reasoning: The question specifically states the study is a case-control study. For case-control studies, the measure of association is the Odds Ratio (OR).

The table is:
|             | Disease + | Disease - |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Exposed +   | 250       | 150       |
| Exposed -   | 100       | 400       |

The Odds Ratio = (Odds of exposure among cases) / (Odds of exposure among controls) = (250/100) / (150/400) = (250 * 400) / (100 * 150).

Looking at the options, only option D provides the correct formula for the odds ratio: (250 * 400) / (150 * 100)
Therefore the answer is D.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between disease and risk factor in a case-control study. In a case-control study, we use the Odds Ratio to estimate this association. The Odds Ratio is calculated as (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls). Looking at the table (which is implicitly described, since the content is not present in the prompt itself, but referenced in the options), we can assume:

- 150 represents cases with the risk factor.
- 250 represents cases without the risk factor.
- 400 represents controls with the risk factor.
- 100 represents controls without the risk factor.

Therefore, the Odds Ratio is (150/250) / (400/100) which simplifies to (150 * 100) / (250 * 400). Option E provides the inverse of this: (150*400)/(250*100). However, the options are formulated differently and this may represent a typo. In order to answer as best as possible, based on the available information, and without any other information than this text, the most likely correct answer is E, because the structure of the Odds Ratio is better represented with the options than using the Relative Risk. If the table showed a different relationship between the cases, controls and risk factors, the answer may be different.

Note that the prompt mentions an image that isn't present, making this more difficult. Without the actual table data, this is the best possible reasoning. It's important to note the possibility of typos in the original question too.",False

Reasoning: The angio-CT scan with mediastinal window in a patient with chest pain and dyspnea suggests the possibility of aortic dissection. The image, although of low resolution, likely demonstrates a widened mediastinum and possible dissection flap, which are characteristic findings of aortic dissection. While other options may be considered, given the clinical scenario and imaging technique, aortic dissection is the most probable diagnosis.",False
1,IT1118,Donna di 87 anni viene condotta in Pronto Soccorso in stato confusionale. La figlia riferisce caduta accidentale in casa con trauma cranico tre giorni prima. Esegue TC Cranio senza mdc che evidenzia un ematoma subdurale destro. Quale dei seguenti aspetti di imaging è tipico dell’ematoma subdurale?,D,True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: The question asks about the typical appearance of a subdural hematoma on imaging. Subdural hematomas are typically crescent-shaped, conforming to the shape of the brain along the dura, giving it an appearance resembling a ""falce"" (sickle or crescent). Epidural hematomas, on the other hand, typically have a biconvex or lens shape. The image confirms a crescent-shaped hyperdensity along the right side of the brain, suggestive of a subdural hematoma.
Options A, B, C, and E are not characteristic of subdural hematomas. ""A sole radiante"" can be associated with meningiomas. ""A lente biconcava"" would be epidural. ""A sale e pepe"" refers to granular changes and has nothing to do with subdural hematomas. ""A lente biconvessa"" is the shape of the epidural hematoma.
""Aspetto a falce"" refers to the crescent shape of a subdural hematoma, which corresponds to the description and what is visible in the CT scan.
The best answer is therefore ""Aspetto a falce"".
The image shows a hyperdense crescent-shaped lesion on the right side, which confirms the presence of a subdural hematoma with the characteristic shape.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.",True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: A subdural hematoma is typically crescent-shaped (a falce in Italian). An epidural hematoma appears biconvex (a lente biconvessa). The other options are not related to subdural hematomas.",True
