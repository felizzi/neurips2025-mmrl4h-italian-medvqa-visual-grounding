Reasoning: The EKG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL, with reciprocal ST depression in leads II, III, and aVF. This pattern suggests an anterior STEMI, which is caused by an occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.",True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: While no specific information is provided in the text of the question to indicate the correct answer, the image appears to be blank. Given the lack of clinical findings, it is impossible to determine the most likely presentation without additional information. However, occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) is a common cause of anterior myocardial infarction, leading to left ventricular dysfunction, and sudden cardiac death. Without more details from the image, occlusion of the LAD is a statistically significant possibility. Options A, B, D, and E are less likely to be inferred without additional data.",True
1,IT0031,"[Paziente uomo di 85 anni, pregresso ictus ischemico, diabetico, in terapia polifarmacologica.

Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes and polypharmacy. He presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled bullae, which are intensely pruritic. The image shows large, tense bullae on an erythematous base. These clinical findings are highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, a common autoimmune blistering disease in elderly patients. Pemphigus vulgaris is less likely because it usually presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement, which is not mentioned in the case. Herpes zoster typically presents with a dermatomal distribution, which is not mentioned here. Contact dermatitis is less likely to present with large, tense bullae. Bullous impetigo typically occurs in children and presents with superficial bullae, which is not characteristic of the image provided. Therefore, bullous pemphigoid is the most probable diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy, presenting with diffuse erythematous urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae with intense pruritus. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease common in the elderly. Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement, which is not described here. Herpes zoster typically presents with a dermatomal distribution. Contact dermatitis would be more localized and related to a specific exposure. Bullous impetigo is typically caused by bacterial infection (S. aureus) and is more common in children.",True

Reasoning: The clinical picture described (elderly patient with comorbidities, urticarial plaques followed by tense bullae with clear content, intense pruritus) suggests a bullous dermatosis. The presence of tense bullae points towards bullous pemphigoid. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to detect antibodies against the basement membrane. While options like anti-desmoglein antibodies (option E) are relevant for pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid is more likely in this scenario, especially considering the age of the patient. Option A refers to celiac disease, which is unlikely given the clinical presentation. Option C (dermatoscopy) and D (Tzank smear) provide less comprehensive information compared to a biopsy. Therefore, the best answer is B.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense blisters with clear content and intense itching. This clinical presentation suggests a bullous dermatosis. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to identify the specific antibody deposition pattern, along with the search for anti-basement membrane antibodies to differentiate between bullous pemphigoid and other bullous diseases.
Option A is related to celiac disease, which is not the primary consideration here.
Option C (dermatoscopy) is not the first-line diagnostic test for bullous diseases.
Option D (Tzank smear) is useful for diagnosing herpes infections, not bullous dermatoses.
Option E involves testing for anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 antibodies, which is more relevant for pemphigus vulgaris, which usually presents with flaccid blisters, unlike the tense blisters described in this case. Bullous pemphigoid, which often starts as urticarial plaques, is more consistent with the provided description.",True

Reasoning:
The study is a case-control study. In a case-control study, we estimate the association between exposure and outcome using the Odds Ratio (OR).
OR = (Odds of exposure among cases) / (Odds of exposure among controls)
OR = (a/c) / (b/d) = (a*d) / (b*c)
Where:
a = number of cases who were exposed = 656
b = number of controls who were exposed = 516
c = number of cases who were not exposed = 214
d = number of controls who were not exposed = 386
OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214)

Option C matches this calculation. Therefore, the answer is C.
RA is risk difference, and RR is risk ratio which are used for cohort studies, not case control studies. Option D is incorrect because it's only 656/386. Options A, B and E are incorrect formulas.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association between exposure (consumption of spirits) and disease (esophageal cancer) is the Odds Ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where a is the number of cases with exposure, b is the number of cases without exposure, c is the number of controls with exposure, and d is the number of controls without exposure. The option C shows the formula correctly as: OR: (656 · 386) / (516 · 214), where 656 represents the cases exposed to the risk factor (alcohol), 386 represents the controls NOT exposed to the risk factor, 516 is cases not exposed, and 214 is controls exposed.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are retrospective studies that are relatively quick and inexpensive compared to cohort or interventional studies. They do not allow for the direct calculation of incidence or prevalence since the study starts with the outcome (cases) and then looks back to assess exposure. The image provided doesn't change the fundamental properties of case-control studies. The table contains data regarding exposure and disease status, useful for calculating odds ratios which are used in case-control studies. This information does not, however, give us information to calculate incidence or prevalence.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and can be completed in a shorter timeframe compared to cohort or intervention studies. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because case-control studies are not designed to calculate incidence or prevalence. They start with cases (individuals with the disease) and controls (individuals without the disease) and then look back in time to assess exposures.

Reasoning: The patient is a 48-year-old male with risk factors (smoker, hypertension) presenting with epigastric pain. He's hypotensive (90/50) and bradycardic (57 bpm). The ECG (although a bit blurry) shows ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads (V1-V4), which is indicative of an anterior STEMI. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is anterior STEMI.",False

Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension, bradycardia, and the ECG shows ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) and reciprocal changes. This is indicative of an acute inferior STEMI, complicated by bradycardia and hypotension. Given this presentation, the patient needs urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). While alerting the cath lab, antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor is crucial to reduce thrombus formation and improve outcomes. Nitroprussiate and enalapril are contraindicated due to the hypotension. Diltiazem would worsen the bradycardia. Warfarin is not indicated in the acute setting of STEMI.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and the ECG (although not visible) prompted alerting the hemodynamics room. This strongly suggests an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely an inferior STEMI complicated by hypotension and bradycardia. The immediate priority is to improve coronary perfusion and prevent further thrombotic events. Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor that should be administered as soon as possible in the setting of suspected ACS. Nitroprussiato di sodio (A) is contraindicated in hypotension. Diltiazem (B) should be avoided due to bradycardia. Warfarin (C) is not for acute management. Enalapril (E) is contraindicated in hypotension.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which suggests an inferior wall myocardial infarction. This is commonly caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). Additionally, the patient has hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardia (57/min), which can be seen in inferior MI involving the RCA. Therefore, the lesion is likely in the right coronary artery.",True,A,"IT0065, A
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which is indicative of an inferior wall myocardial infarction. This is most likely due to an occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's bradycardia (HR 57) and hypotension (90/50) also support this, as the RCA supplies the SA node in a large percentage of people, and right ventricular infarction can cause hypotension.",True
1,IT0095,"[Un ragazzo di 23 anni è vittima di un incidente automobilistico (moto contro auto). All'arrivo dei soccorsi viene riferito il seguente esame obiettivo neurologico: il paziente giace a occhi chiusi, non li apre né allo stimolo verbale né allo stimolo doloroso, eloquio assente, alla stimolazione algica il paziente tende ad allontanare gli arti dalla fonte dello stimolo. Presenta anisocoria per destra > sinistra.] Il paziente viene trasferito presso il Pronto Soccorso dove viene sottoposto a una TC cerebrale. Quale reperto è verosimilmente apprezzabile alla TC?",C,True,D,"IT0095, D
Reasoning: The clinical picture describes a young man with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score likely indicating a severe head injury (eyes closed to pain, no verbal response, withdrawal to pain). The anisocoria suggests possible uncal herniation. The CT scan shows a hyperdense, crescent-shaped lesion that conforms to the shape of the dura mater, characteristic of an acute subdural hematoma. The presentation is consistent with a traumatic injury. An epidural hematoma typically has a lenticular shape, an intraparenchymal hematoma is within the brain tissue, a chronic subdural hematoma is less dense, and a subgaleal hematoma is outside the skull.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's neurological exam points to a significant brain injury: GCS would be estimated around 6-7. Anisocoria suggests a mass effect causing uncal herniation, which leads to compression of the third cranial nerve. Given the acute presentation following a high-impact trauma (motorcycle vs. car accident), an intraparenchymal hematoma is the most likely finding on CT scan. While epidural or subdural hematomas are also possibilities after such trauma, intraparenchymal hematomas are quite common especially with high energy injuries and can explain the anisocoria and the neurological status. Chronic subdural hematomas are less likely in the context of an acute trauma. Subgaleal hematomas would not explain the altered mental status or anisocoria.",False

Reasoning: The radiograph shows the humeral head is anterior and inferior to the glenoid fossa, which is indicative of an anterior shoulder dislocation. This is also consistent with the described mechanism of injury (fall on outstretched hand with the shoulder in slight abduction and extension). The other options are less likely given the presentation and radiograph. There is no evidence of fracture in the image. The acromioclavicular joint appears normal. A posterior dislocation is less common and would usually result from a different mechanism.",True,B,"IT0111, B
Reasoning: The question describes a 37-year-old man presenting to the emergency room with severe pain in his right shoulder after falling on his outstretched hand with the shoulder slightly abducted and extended. This mechanism of injury is highly suggestive of an anterior shoulder dislocation (luxation anteriore dell'articolazione gleno-omerale). The X-ray further confirms the diagnosis of anterior shoulder dislocation. The other options are less likely given the mechanism of injury described.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a view of the lumbar spine where the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs are seen in profile, as well as the spinal cord. This is characteristic of a sagittal plane. Given the clear and direct view along the midline, it is most likely a pure sagittal plane. Oblique sagittal views would not give such a clear and straight profile of the vertebral column. The other options are incorrect because they would show different anatomical structures in a different orientation.",True,A,"IT0130, A
Reasoning: The image shows a side view of the lumbar spine, visualizing the vertebrae stacked on top of each other. This is characteristic of a sagittal plane.",True
1,IT0131,[Paziente di 45 anni esegue indagine Risonanza Magnetica della colonna lombare per lombalgia da 2 mesi non responsiva ai farmaci antifiammatori.] Nella RM si rileva una probabile metastasi ossea. Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate imaging to identify the presence of bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy is a highly sensitive method for detecting bone metastases, as it visualizes areas of increased bone turnover. While CT can also detect bone metastases, bone scintigraphy is generally preferred for initial screening due to its higher sensitivity for early lesions. TC of the entire skeleton would be more specific but expose the patient to unnecessary radiation. Ultrasound is not useful for evaluating bone metastasis and cannot scan all bone structures.
Therefore, A is the most appropriate answer. The image shows the lumbar spine MRI, which raised the suspicion of bone metastases.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate test to identify bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy (A) is a highly sensitive technique for detecting bone metastases, as it highlights areas of increased bone turnover, which is common in metastatic disease. While CT scans (B, C, E) can also detect bone metastases, they are generally less sensitive than bone scintigraphy for early detection. Ultrasound (D) is not typically used for detecting bone metastases. Therefore, bone scintigraphy is the best initial test in this scenario.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with erythematous-hyperkeratotic lesions on the scapular region and hyperkeratotic lesions with cicatricial alopecia on the scalp. The lesions tend to worsen with sun exposure and show a tendency towards cicatricial atrophy and hyperpigmentation. This clinical presentation is consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Hydroxychloroquine is a common treatment for DLE. Phototherapy is contraindicated as the condition worsens with sun exposure. Topical calcipotriol would not be effective. Penicillin and antifungals are not indicated for this condition. Thus, hydroxychloroquine is the most appropriate therapy.",True,B,"IT0169, B
Reasoning: The description points towards a diagnosis of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE). The features like erythematous-hyperkeratotic nummular lesions on the scapular region, hyperkeratotic lesions with cicatricial alopecia on the scalp vertex, long-standing lesions on the trunk tending to atrophic scarring and hyperpigmentation, and worsening with sun exposure are all characteristic of DLE. Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for DLE. Other options are less suitable: nbUVB phototherapy is generally avoided in lupus erythematosus due to its potential to exacerbate the condition. Calcipotriol is used for psoriasis. Penicillin is an antibiotic and would not be appropriate here. Oral antifungals are used to treat fungal infections.",True

Reasoning: The histological findings described - villous atrophy (flattening of villi), crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes - are characteristic of celiac disease. While non-celiac gluten sensitivity can cause some similar symptoms, the histological findings are not as pronounced or specific. Whipple's disease shows macrophages in the lamina propria, Crohn's disease typically involves patchy inflammation and granulomas, and a neuroendocrine tumor would present as a mass of neuroendocrine cells.",True,C,"IT0198, C
Reasoning: The histological findings of villous atrophy (flattening of villi), crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes are highly suggestive of celiac disease. While other conditions might show some similar features, the combination of these three is most characteristic of celiac disease. Whipple's disease involves PAS-positive macrophages. Crohn's disease typically has granulomas and transmural inflammation. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not typically cause villous atrophy.

Reasoning: The X-ray shows multiple well-defined, spherical opacities scattered throughout both lung fields. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases, particularly given the round appearance of the lesions. Tuberculous lesions are more often nodular and less sharply defined than these, and miliary TB will involve very small lesions distributed throughout the lung, not these sized lesions. Pneumonia tends to be localized and consolidative, and atelectasis would present with volume loss. Electrode shadows would be located on the skin surface and appear much smaller and less distinct.
Therefore, B is the most probable answer.",True,B,"IT0200, B
Reasoning: The image shows multiple, well-defined, rounded opacities throughout both lung fields. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases. Options A, C, D, and E do not typically present with this radiographic appearance. Miliary tuberculosis presents with smaller, more diffuse nodules. Pneumonia often appears as consolidation or patchy infiltrates. Atelectasis would present as a collapsed lung segment. EKG leads would not cause such diffuse opacities.",True

Reasoning: The rhythm in the image displays a rapid, wide-complex tachycardia with varying QRS morphologies. This is characteristic of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes), which is a life-threatening arrhythmia associated with sudden cardiac arrest. Monomorphic VT would have uniform QRS complexes. Atrial fibrillation would have an irregular R-R interval with absent P waves. Supraventricular tachycardia would usually have narrow QRS complexes (unless there is underlying bundle branch block or aberrant conduction). Ventricular fibrillation would be a chaotic, irregular waveform with no discernible QRS complexes. The patient's loss of consciousness also suggests a serious arrhythmia like VT.",True,E,"IT0213, E

Reasoning: The ECG shows Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). The patient is pulseless and has lost consciousness, therefore the appropriate treatment is defibrillation. Lidocaine is sometimes used for VT, but only if the patient has a pulse. Vagal maneuvers would not be appropriate and adrenaline is used for asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Fluid expansion is unlikely to be helpful.",True,A,"IT0214, A
Reasoning: The patient has lost consciousness due to retrosternal pain that did not improve. This suggests a possible cardiac event leading to cardiac arrest. The first-line treatment for cardiac arrest is defibrillation, assuming the patient is in a shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia). Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic, volume expansion treats hypovolemia, vagal maneuvers treat supraventricular tachycardia, and epinephrine is used in cardiac arrest for non-shockable rhythms or after defibrillation attempts.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a body in advanced decomposition with marbling, bloating, and insect activity (maggots). Rigor mortis typically resolves after about 36-72 hours. Given the complete resolution of rigor and the advanced decomposition, it suggests a time since death of approximately 3-5 days.

Options C, D, and E are highly unlikely given the visible decomposition signs. Option B is unlikely because the rigor has resolved and the body is too decomposed.",True,A,"IT0229, A
Reasoning: The question states that rigor mortis has completely resolved. Rigor mortis typically resolves within 36-72 hours. Given that the discovery occurred in Sicily in August and the presence of a strong odor suggesting decomposition, a time frame of 3-5 days since death is most plausible. The complete resolution of rigor mortis makes options B (less than 24 hours) and the longer durations in options C, D, and E unlikely.

Reasoning: The image shows a hyperdense (bright) area in the left fronto-parietal region, consistent with a bleed. The patient's sudden onset of headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis, along with the history of hypertension and cirrhosis, strongly suggest a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The location on the CT scan corresponds to the clinical findings (left hemisphere affecting language and right motor function). An epidural hematoma would typically have a lens shape and be associated with trauma. A subdural hematoma would typically have a crescent shape. An ischemic stroke would be hypodense (dark) on the CT scan, especially in the early stages. A subarachnoid hemorrhage typically appears as blood in the subarachnoid spaces, often around the circle of Willis.",True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache and vomiting, followed by aphasia and right hemiparesis. His history includes hypertension and liver cirrhosis due to alcoholism. The CT scan reveals a hyperdense area in the left frontoparietal region, which is consistent with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The symptoms (aphasia, right hemiparesis) also correlate with the location (left hemisphere).

A) Epidural hematomas are typically associated with trauma.
B) Subdural hematomas are often crescent-shaped. The location mentioned (parieto-occipital) doesn't match the symptoms so well.
D) While a stroke is possible, the sudden onset headache and vomiting suggest a hemorrhagic event. The CT scan will show hypodensity in case of ischemic stroke.
E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage usually presents with a severe headache and is not always associated with focal deficits (but is possible). The CT image doesn't clearly suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage, and given the context, a parenchymal hemorrhage is more likely.",True

Nelle ultime settimane sarebbero inoltre comparse delle difficoltà nell'eloquio. La paziente si reca quindi dal neurologo che riscontra un deficit stenico all'arto superiore di destra e una afasia espressiva. Consiglia quindi l'esecuzione di una RM encefalo con mezzo di contrasto. Tale esame evidenzia la presenza di una lesione espansiva verosimilmente extra-assiale a livello frontale destro, captante vivacemente e omogeneamente contrasto, associata a ispessimento della dura madre perilesionale (tail durale) (si veda immagine).] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The patient has a progressive right arm weakness and language difficulties (aphasia). The MRI shows an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal area that enhances strongly with contrast and has a dural tail. Meningiomas are the most common extra-axial brain tumors and are often located in the frontal convexity. They typically enhance brightly with contrast and exhibit a dural tail. The lesion is in the right frontal area, therefore it's most likely related to the left side's symptoms. Gliomas are intra-axial lesions. Metastases typically don't have a dural tail. Hematomas and hemorrhages are not contrast-enhancing.
Since the lesion is on the RIGHT side of the brain (frontale destro), and the symptoms are on the RIGHT arm (deficit stenico all'arto superiore di destra), due to the effects being contralateral, this indicates that the lesion is on the LEFT side of the brain (meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra). Therefore, A is the best option.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description points to a meningioma. The key elements are: a slowly progressing weakness of the right arm and speech difficulties (suggesting a left frontal lobe problem). RM shows an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal area (which would cause left weakness). The contrast enhancement and dural tail are characteristic signs of meningioma. Given that the symptoms are on the right side and that the question states that the mass is frontal right, the correct option is A.
Option B is less probable since it states that the mass is on the left side.
Option C is less probable because contrast enhancement would be unlikely in a metastasis.

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly at night, which resolves with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). The images show a small, well-defined lesion in the femur with surrounding sclerosis. This clinical and radiographic presentation is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. Osteoid osteomas are known to cause pain that is worse at night and is often relieved by aspirin. The radiographic appearance of a small, sclerotic lesion with surrounding reactive bone formation is also characteristic of osteoid osteoma. The other options are less likely. Chondroblastoma usually occurs in the epiphysis, not the diaphysis. Chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma are typically more aggressive lesions with a different age distribution and radiographic appearance. Enchondromas are typically asymptomatic unless complicated by fracture.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old with intense thigh pain, predominantly at night, relieved by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). This is a classic presentation of osteoid osteoma. Osteoid osteomas often cause nocturnal pain that is relieved by NSAIDs, especially aspirin. The other options are less likely to present with this specific symptom pattern. Condroblastoma typically occurs in the epiphysis of long bones, chondrosarcoma is more common in older adults, osteosarcoma is also possible in this age group but the pain relief with aspirin is not a typical feature, and enchondroma is often asymptomatic.",True

Reasoning: The image and description suggest condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgery are all appropriate treatment options for condylomata acuminata. Salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used for genital warts. Corticosteroids can even worsen the condition by suppressing the local immune response. Therefore, topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not indicated.",True,E,"IT0311, E
Reasoning: The description suggests condylomata acuminata (genital warts) due to the presence of pinkish-brown papules in the perineal region that sometimes merge into plaques and are asymptomatic.

Quale è la diagnosi più probabile?",B,True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset dyspnea, hypotension, and hypoxemia, highly suggestive of pulmonary embolism. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and right heart strain (S1Q3T3 pattern can be seen, though not very pronounced). The recent prostatectomy is a risk factor for thromboembolic events. While other options could be considered, pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis given the clinical and ECG findings. Brugada syndrome does not typically present with dyspnea. Aortic dissection usually presents with severe chest pain and different blood pressure in the arms. Heart failure may be possible, but unlikely to cause sudden onset dyspnea in an otherwise stable patient. Post-operative anemia usually does not cause such sudden hypoxemia.
The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, possible right axis deviation, and a possible S1Q3T3 pattern.
These findings are consistent with pulmonary embolism.
Other causes like heart failure or anemia can be excluded given the acute onset and ECG findings.
Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease and does not typically present in this manner. Aortic dissection would involve significant chest pain.
Therefore, pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis.",True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old man with hypertension, a smoker, who recently underwent prostatectomy. He presents with dyspnea of 5 hours duration. His vital signs show hypotension (100/50 mmHg) and hypoxemia (SpO2 88%). The ECG (image) shows sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern, which is suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. Recent surgery is also a risk factor for DVT and subsequent pulmonary embolism. While other conditions could cause dyspnea and hypotension, the ECG findings and risk factors make pulmonary embolism the most likely diagnosis.",True

Reasoning: The clinical history of an 82-year-old man with recent falls and neurological deficits (speech and motor) plus anticoagulant therapy makes subdural hematoma highly likely. The CT scan described as a crescent-shaped (semiluna) collection that is iso-hypodense relative to brain parenchyma confirms a chronic subdural hematoma. The ""chronic"" part is favored by the time frame of several weeks since the trauma, and the density characteristics on CT.",True,A,"IT0512, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech disturbances, right-sided weakness) and a history of head trauma 4 weeks prior. He is also on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of bleeding. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso- to hypodense, which is typical of a chronic subdural hematoma. Acute subdural hematomas are usually hyperdense. The shape helps differentiate it from intraparenchymal or epidural hematomas. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is also less likely with these CT findings.",True

Reasoning: In image A, the CSF appears dark, and the white matter is brighter than the gray matter, which is characteristic of a T1-weighted image. In image B, the CSF appears bright, which is indicative of a T2-weighted image. Since the question mentions that the patient underwent an MRI examination of the brain for a headache resistant to first-line treatments, and image B does not show any enhancement or hyperintensity after contrast administration, image B is most likely a T1-weighted image with contrast agent. So, the correct answer is E.",False,E,"IT0532, E
Reasoning: In a T1-weighted image, fluid appears dark (hypointense). In a T2-weighted image, fluid appears bright (hyperintense). Image A shows dark ventricles and sulci, which is consistent with a T1-weighted image. Image B shows brighter areas within the lesion, suggesting contrast enhancement which is used in T1 weighted imaging. Therefore, Image B is a T1-weighted image with contrast.",False

Reasoning: The X-ray shows a clear demarcation line on the left lung, with the lung tissue appearing collapsed towards the hilum and an absence of lung markings in the upper left region. This is consistent with a pneumothorax. The patient's symptoms (sudden onset of sharp chest pain and dyspnea) and smoking history further support this diagnosis. The pain is referred to the left side, and so the pneumothorax would be left-sided.
A versamento pleurico sinistro would present as opacity at the base of the lung, obscuring the diaphragmatic border. An edema polmonare would be bilateral, with vascular congestion and often Kerley B lines. Polmonite basale sinistra would present as consolidation in the lower lung. Neoplasia polmonare destra would appear as a mass within the right lung field.",True,E,"IT0563, E

Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (chest pain, diaphoresis, jugular constriction). The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6, consistent with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Therefore, the next step is emergent coronary angiography (<2 hours) for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). While troponin levels would eventually rise and confirm myocardial damage, they do not direct immediate management. Angio-CT of the chest could be considered later, but the emergent finding of STEMI indicates a primary PCI approach is needed. Measuring inflammatory markers or viral antigens is not relevant in this acute setting. Coronary angiography within 24 hours is not fast enough given the urgency of STEMI.",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, profuse sweating, jugular constriction, hypertension, and a normal oxygen saturation. These symptoms are highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Given the patient's risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia) and the presentation, a suspected myocardial infarction is the most probable diagnosis.

Analyzing the ECG (although not visible but its existence is mentioned in the question), in the context of the clinical suspicion of ACS, an emergent coronary angiography is needed to visualize the coronary arteries and identify any occlusion that requires immediate intervention (PCI/stenting). The question asks for the NEXT step.

Option A, Angio-CT, can be useful to exclude other causes of chest pain (pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection), but is not the priority here when ACS is highly suspected and there is ECG in the prompt.
Option B, Troponin level, is used to confirm myocardial damage, but the prompt asks for the ""next"" step, thus before confirmation is needed to examine the arteries.
Option C, Dosage of inflammatory markers/viral antigens, is not relevant in this acute setting with high suspicion of ACS.
Option E, Coronary angiography urgently (<24 hours), is not emergent enough given the patient's presentation.

Therefore, an emergent coronary angiography (<2 hours) is the most appropriate next step.",True

Reasoning: The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, venous dilation and tortuosity, and cotton-wool spots, all indicative of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The patient's age and cardiovascular risk factors (cardiac disease, hypertension) further support this diagnosis. While diabetic retinopathy can present with hemorrhages, the pattern is more diffuse and less confluent than seen here. Branch retinal vein occlusion would typically involve a sector of the retina rather than the entire fundus. Age-related macular degeneration doesn't manifest with the widespread hemorrhages shown in the picture. Serous central retinitis doesn't usually show hemorrhages as the primary finding.",True,B,"IT0653, B
Reasoning: The image shows a fundus photograph with widespread hemorrhages, tortuous veins, and cotton wool spots. This is highly suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The patient's age (75), hypertension, and cardiac condition further support this diagnosis.
A) Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy would typically show microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, and hard exudates, which are not as prominent in the image.
C) Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) would show hemorrhages confined to a specific quadrant of the retina, not the widespread pattern observed.

Reasoning: The image shows a hyperdense lesion in the left parieto-occipital region of the brain. This suggests a parenchymal hemorrhage. The location is in the brain parenchyma, so it is not subdural or epidural. Given the hyperdensity on the CT scan, it is not a normal finding, so MRI is not immediately needed. The hemorrhage is on the left side of the image (which corresponds to the left side of the brain).

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a hyperdense area within the brain parenchyma in the left parieto-occipital region, indicative of a parenchymal hemorrhage. Subdural hematomas are typically crescent-shaped and located between the dura and arachnoid mater. Epidural hematomas are typically lens-shaped and located between the dura and the skull.

Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain and nausea, and has a history of diabetes, increasing the likelihood of an acute coronary syndrome. The ECG shows possible ST-segment depression in leads V1-V3 and T wave inversion in inferior leads II, III, aVF, suggestive of ischemia. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention is to admit the patient to a monitored cardiac bed for serial ECGs and troponin measurements to rule out an acute coronary syndrome. Options B, C, D, and E are inappropriate at this stage. Coronary angiography might be needed but only after initial assessment with ECGs and troponins.

Reasoning: The patient presents with acute knee pain, swelling, and a sensation of knee locking after a twisting injury. The range of motion is limited (20-90 degrees). These symptoms are highly suggestive of a meniscal tear, specifically a ""bucket-handle"" tear, which can cause the knee to lock. While other injuries are possible, the combination of locking, limited range of motion, and the description of the injury strongly points to a meniscal tear. The images confirm this. Image A appears to show a meniscal tear in an arthroscopic view, and Image B on the MRI likely demonstrates the same tear.

Pediculosis (lice) often affects the head, urticaria presents with wheals (hives), bullous pemphigoid causes large blisters, and cutaneous leishmaniasis presents with ulcers or nodules, not the described linear lesions.",True
1,IT0891,"Giunge al reparto di dermatologia una paziente di 60 anni con eruzione maculo-papulosa morbilliforme diffusa, edema del volto, intenso prurito e febbre elevata.

Reasoning: The patient presents with a maculopapular morbilliform rash, facial edema, pruritus, and fever, which started three weeks after starting allopurinol. The lab results show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver and pancreatic enzymes. These clinical and laboratory findings are highly suggestive of Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). SDRIFE typically involves intertriginous areas, Nicolau dermatitis involves livedoid lesions, AGEP presents with pustules, and Sezary syndrome is a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The image shows facial edema consistent with the DRESS syndrome.",True,C,"IT0891, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with a morbilliform rash, facial edema, pruritus, fever, recent allopurinol use, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver and pancreatic enzymes. These findings strongly suggest Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).",True
1,IT0892,Allo striscio di sangue periferico si osserva questa morfologia eritrocitaria con schistociti. Il quadro è indicativo di:,E,True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) in the peripheral blood smear is a characteristic finding in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is a condition characterized by the fragmentation of red blood cells as they pass through damaged or narrowed small blood vessels. The other options are less likely given the morphology: Drepanocytes (sickle cells) are associated with sickle cell anemia, spherocytes are seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, elliptocytes are associated with elliptocytosis and macro-ovalocytes are seen in megaloblastic anemia.",True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The question describes a peripheral blood smear showing schistocytes. Schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) are characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). The options provided are:
A) Drepanocytosis (sickle cell anemia) - presents with sickle cells, not schistocytes.
B) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia - can cause spherocytes and other abnormalities, but not typically schistocytes.
C) Elliptocytosis - presents with elliptocytes (oval-shaped red blood cells).
D) Macro-ovalocytosis - presents with large oval-shaped red blood cells, often seen in megaloblastic anemias.
E) Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia - the hallmark of MAHA is the presence of schistocytes in the peripheral blood smear.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.",True
1,IT0908,Un paziente di 85 anni giunge all’ambulatorio di Endoscopia Digestiva per eseguire una esofagogastroduodenoscopia (EGDS) in seguito a riferita emissione di feci scure con riscontro agli esami ematochimici di anemia (Hb:8 g/dL) ipocromica microcitica. L’EGDS mostra in sede antrale il quadro riportato. Qual è la diagnosi endoscopica di quanto osservato?,A,True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and anemia, suggesting upper GI bleeding. The EGDS reveals an antral lesion. The image shows an ulcer with a flat, adherent clot at the base, consistent with Forrest IIc classification. Forrest IIc indicates a flat spot, which is frequently seen after bleeding has stopped or slowed significantly. The other options are less likely based on the endoscopic appearance: a Forrest I ulcer presents with active spurting bleeding, Forrest III shows an ulcer with a clean base, a hyperplastic polyp is usually a raised lesion and a diverticulum would present as a pouch.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena (dark stools), anemia, and the EGDS shows a lesion in the antrum. The question asks for the endoscopic diagnosis based on the image. Based on the image, a Forrest IIc ulcer appears to be the most accurate description. Forrest IIc refers to a flat spot with overlying clot, which is a sign of recent bleeding, consistent with the patient's presentation. While Forrest I indicates active spurting, Forrest III indicates clean ulcer base. Polyp or diverticulum would not explain the melena and anemia.",True
1,IT0919,"Un paziente di 56 anni si presenta in Pronto Soccorso con dolore diffuso in zona epigastrica. Appare ansioso, agitato, in cerca di una posizione per alleviare il dolore.

Si procede all’effettuazione di un ECG, emocromo, dosaggio enzimi specifici (Troponina, CPK, SGOT, LDH), RX torace, ecocardiogramma ed eco addome. Sono presenti leucocitosi ed iperglicemia. Si rimane in attesa del referto di enzimi specifici. Il referto dell’ECG è il seguente. Alla luce del quadro clinico ed elettrocardiografico, quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",E,True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, consistent with an anterior STEMI. The patient's clinical presentation of epigastric pain, anxiety, diaphoresis, and vomiting further supports this diagnosis. While waiting for the troponin results, the ECG changes are highly suggestive of an acute STEMI. Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia are also common findings in acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, STEMI is the most probable diagnosis.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in multiple leads (I, aVL, V2-V6). This, along with the patient's symptoms (chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, bradycardia), suggests a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia can also be seen in acute myocardial infarction. Pericarditis is less likely given the ST elevation pattern and clinical presentation. A right bundle branch block would present with a different morphology on ECG. NSTEMI is less likely as the ECG shows ST-segment elevation rather than ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion.",True
1,IT0949,"Una paziente di 56 anni è affetta da carcinoma squamocellulare della cervice uterina, inoperabile per estesa infiltrazione dei paramétri. Il trattamento programmato consiste in una chemioradioterapia.

Come si definisce quest’ultima tecnica di trattamento?",E,True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes the placement of an applicator containing Iridium-192 sources within the vagina and uterus. This is a form of brachytherapy where the radiation source is placed inside a body cavity, which is specifically known as intracavitary brachytherapy. Interstitial brachytherapy (A) involves placing the source directly within the tissue of the tumor. External beam radiation (B) delivers radiation from outside the body. Radio-immunotherapy (C) involves combining radioactive isotopes with antibodies. Intraoperative radiation therapy (D) is delivered during surgery.
The image also confirms the placement of the applicator inside the body cavity to target the tumor.",True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes a 56-year-old patient with inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix undergoing chemoradiotherapy. The radiotherapy involves irradiation of the pelvic region followed by the placement of an applicator loaded with Iridium-192 sources into the vagina and uterus. This technique, placing radioactive sources within a body cavity (vagina and uterus), is defined as intracavitary brachytherapy.",True

Alla luce del quadro ECG e dei parametri vitali quale tra i seguenti è l’intervento terapeutico più appropriato?",E,True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a heart rate of 180 bpm. Her blood pressure is relatively stable at 110/65 mmHg. First-line treatment for stable SVT is vagal maneuvers and/or adenosine. Atropine and Isoproterenol would be detrimental by further increasing the heart rate. Cardioversion is considered if the patient is unstable. KCl administration is not indicated. The ECG confirms the diagnosis of SVT as there are no visible P waves and the QRS complexes are narrow and regular. Adenosine works by transiently blocking the AV node, thus interrupting the re-entry circuit.",True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to nodal reentry. The first-line treatment for stable SVT is adenosine. Atropine is used for bradycardia. Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic agonist used for bradycardia or heart block, not SVT. Cardioversion is used for unstable SVT. KCl is not indicated in this scenario. Adenosine is the correct initial treatment for stable SVT.",True
1,IT1022,"Un uomo di 73 anni, seguito per un pregresso melanoma del dorso, presenta ad un controllo programmato una neoformazione della regione sottoclavicolare destra, nettamente aumentata dall’ultimo controllo, di circa 3 cm di diametro, rilevata, di colore marrone chiaro, ruvida al tatto. Sono presenti altre neoformazioni simili, di diametro minore, sia a livello del torace che del collo. Alla dermatoscopia si apprezzano sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee. Quale diagnosi suggeriscono la clinica e la dermatoscopia?",D,True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description mentions a rapidly growing lesion with ""follicular plugs"" and ""horn cysts"" visible on dermatoscopy. These are characteristic of seborrheic keratosis. Melanoma is less likely given the description of multiple similar lesions. Basal cell carcinoma typically has a pearly appearance with telangiectasia. Dysplastic nevi generally lack the comedo-like openings and cysts. Squamous cell carcinoma would likely present as a more ulcerated or crusted lesion. The image also shows the typical morphology of seborrheic keratosis. Thus, seborrheic keratosis is the most appropriate diagnosis. Given the description and the dermatoscopic findings, particularly the ""sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee"", the answer is Cheratosi seborroica pigmentata (pigmented seborrheic keratosis). The clinical picture of other lesions, and dermoscopy in the question also favors seborrheic keratoses.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description of the lesions (multiple, elevated, light brown, rough, with comedo-like openings and pseudocysts) and the dermatoscopic findings are characteristic of seborrheic keratosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the description doesn't strongly suggest melanoma recurrence. Basal cell carcinoma typically presents with pearly papules or nodules. Dysplastic nevi are moles with unusual features, but the dermatoscopic findings mentioned are more typical of seborrheic keratosis. Squamous cell carcinoma is less likely given the description of the lesions. Pigmented seborrheic keratosis fits the description well.",True
1,IT1023,"Maschio di 40 anni, celiaco, si presenta all’osservazione con un’eruzione papulo-vescicolosa, simmetrica che si localizza preferenzialmente alle superfici estensorie degli arti. Il paziente riferisce intenso prurito e bruciore per il quale non ha trovato giovamento da una terapia con antistaminico per os prescritta dal Medico di Medicina Generale. Il segno di Nikolski è assente. Agli esami ematici si riscontrano anticorpi IgA anti-transglutaminasi epidermica (TG3) e anti-transglutaminasi tessutale a basso titolo. Viene eseguita una biopsia della cute che evidenzia uno scollamento dermo-epidermico alla microscopia ottica e, all’immunofluorescenza diretta, depositi granulari di IgA situati all'apice delle papille dermiche. Quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with a symmetrical papulo-vesicular eruption on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, intense itching and burning, absence of Nikolski's sign, IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies, dermo-epidermal detachment on biopsy, and granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae. These findings are highly suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis, especially in a patient with celiac disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. The presence of IgA anti-TG3 antibodies and the characteristic IgA deposits on immunofluorescence further support this diagnosis. The image is also consistent with the presentation of dermatitis herpetiformis.
While other conditions can present with blistering lesions, the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results points most strongly to dermatitis herpetiformis.
Dermatosis a IgA lineare typically presents with a linear pattern of IgA deposition on immunofluorescence, not granular. Pemphigus vulgaris would have a positive Nikolski's sign and would not have IgA deposition. Scabies is intensely pruritic, but the lesions are different and would not have the same biopsy findings. Bullous pemphigoid would show IgG and C3 deposition along the basement membrane zone, not IgA.
Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is dermatitis herpetiformis.",True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The key elements for the diagnosis are:
1. Celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are strongly associated with Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH).
2. The description of the lesions is characteristic for DH (papulo-vesicular eruption, symmetric distribution, preference for extensor surfaces of limbs, intense pruritus and burning).
3. IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies are found in DH. Specifically, IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) antibodies are most commonly associated with DH.
4. The biopsy result shows dermo-epidermal separation and granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae. This immunofluorescence pattern is pathognomonic for DH.

Option B (Linear IgA bullous dermatosis) is possible, however linear IgA is associated with a linear pattern along the basement membrane. Options C, D, and E are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation, serology, and immunofluorescence findings. Therefore, Dermatitis Herpetiformis is the most probable diagnosis.",True
1,IT1044,"Una signora di 67 anni con storia di dispnea da sforzo, mai indagata in precedenza e mai sottoposta ad intervento chirurgico toracico, esegue spirometria. Sulla base dei risultati di seguito riportati quale sindrome disventilatoria è più probabile tra le seguenti?",C,True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The spirometry results show that FVC and FEV1 are significantly reduced compared to the reference values (57% and 60% respectively). The FEV1/FVC ratio is 78%, which is within the normal range (65.9-89.5%). Total Lung Capacity (TLC) is also reduced (43% of reference). These findings are indicative of a restrictive ventilatory defect. In restrictive lung diseases, lung volumes are decreased. Options A, B and D do not correspond to a Restrictive Pattern. Option E may be relevant if the image showed a Bronchoprovocation test with positive result. Since it doesn't, option C is the only likely option.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The question describes a 67-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea undergoing spirometry. The image shows the spirometry results. Based on the image, the FEV1/FVC ratio is significantly reduced (55%). The FVC is also reduced (60% predicted) suggesting a restrictive ventilatory defect. Option C, ""Sindrome disventilatoria di tipo restrittivo"" (Restrictive ventilatory syndrome), is the most likely diagnosis based on these findings.",True

Viene eseguito un ECG il cui tracciato è riportato qui di seguito. Quale tra i seguenti è il trattamento più adeguato?",C,True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (3rd-degree AV block). There is no relationship between the P waves and QRS complexes. The QRS complexes are also wide. The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness). The most appropriate treatment is a pacemaker implantation. Cardioversion and defibrillation are not indicated because the patient is not in a shockable rhythm (such as ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). Midodrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist used to treat orthostatic hypotension, which is not the issue here. Stopping the ACE inhibitor is unlikely to resolve the complete heart block.",True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (AV block of third degree). The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness). The most appropriate treatment for a symptomatic complete heart block is pacemaker implantation.
A) Cardioversion is used for unstable tachyarrhythmias.
B) Midodrine is a vasopressor and is used for orthostatic hypotension.
D) ACE inhibitor suspension may be considered if hypotension is causing the symptoms, but given the complete heart block, this is unlikely to be the primary cause.
E) Defibrillation is used for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",True
1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question explicitly states that the study is a case-control study. For case-control studies, the correct measure of association is the odds ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (exposed with disease * non-exposed without disease) / (exposed without disease * non-exposed with disease). Looking at the table, this translates to (250 * 400) / (150 * 100). Option E correctly represents this calculation as (150*400) / (250*100). Other options are incorrect because they calculate either Risk Ratio or Attributable Risk, which are not appropriate for Case-Control studies. Risk ratio and Attributable Risk calculations are also not correct given the values in the table. Therefore, only option E is a plausible answer. Pay attention that I have to invert the numbers, as in the table provided the numbers are ""malati"" as exposed and ""non malati"" as non-exposed, so: (150 * 400) / (250 * 100).",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between disease and risk factor in a case-control study. In case-control studies, we use the Odds Ratio (OR) to estimate the association. Looking at the image (the table), let's define:
- a = 150 (exposed cases)
- b = 250 (unexposed cases)
- c = 400 (exposed controls)
- d = 100 (unexposed controls)

The Odds Ratio is calculated as (a*d) / (b*c). Plugging in the values from the table, OR = (150*100) / (250*400), but we have to notice the question asks for the *table below*, so the rows and columns are flipped. Then we have:
- a = 150
- b = 400
- c = 250
- d = 100
Then, the correct formula becomes OR = (a*d) / (b*c) = (150 * 400) / (250 * 100). Therefore, option E is correct.",False

Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain worsening with breathing. The chest X-ray shows some infiltrates, and the CT scan with contrast shows filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, indicative of pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism. Aortic dissection may cause chest pain and dyspnea, but the CT would show a dissection flap, which is not evident. Similarly, other options, like pericardial effusion, myocardial infarction or myocarditis don't fit to the CT scan.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain worsening with breathing, suggesting a pulmonary issue. The chest X-ray and CT scan with contrast are performed. The image shows a filling defect within the pulmonary artery, which is characteristic of a pulmonary embolism. While other options might cause chest pain, the imaging findings point strongly to pulmonary embolism.",False
1,IT1114,Donna di 45 anni giunge in Pronto Soccorso per dolore toracico e dispnea. Viene eseguito uno studio angioTC con mdc del torace. L’immagine riportata mostra lo studio visualizzato con finestra per mediastino. Qual è la diagnosi più probabile fra le seguenti?,A,True,E,"IT1114, E
Reasoning: The image shows a CT scan of the chest with contrast, viewed with mediastinal windows. The ascending aorta appears dilated, and there's a clear flap visible within the aortic lumen, indicating a dissection. This is consistent with an aortic dissection. The mediastinal window helps visualizing the aorta and the surrounding tissues. The patient's symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea are also common with aortic dissection.",False,E,"IT1114, E
Reasoning: The angio-CT with contrast enhancement visualized with a mediastinal window in a patient presenting with chest pain and dyspnea strongly suggests aortic dissection. This is because the mediastinal window is optimal for evaluating the aorta and surrounding structures, and the contrast enhancement allows visualization of the aortic lumen and any potential dissection flap or false lumen.",False

Reasoning: The question describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are typically crescent-shaped on imaging, which can be described as ""a falce"" in Italian, which translates to ""sickle-shaped"" or ""crescent-shaped"". Epidural hematomas, on the other hand, are usually described as ""biconvex"". The image provided also shows a crescent-shaped hematoma. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: An epidural hematoma typically appears biconvex (lens-shaped) on imaging, while a subdural hematoma typically appears crescent-shaped (like a falx) because it can spread more freely across the brain surface. Therefore, ""aspetto a falce"" (aspect like a falx) is the typical appearance of a subdural hematoma. Option E describes a epidural hematoma, which is an ""aspetto a lente biconvessa"".",True
