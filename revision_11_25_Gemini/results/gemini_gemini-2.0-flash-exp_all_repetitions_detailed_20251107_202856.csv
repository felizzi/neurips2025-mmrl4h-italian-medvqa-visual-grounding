Reasoning: The ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, absent P waves, and variable R-R intervals, which are characteristic of atrial fibrillation. There are no ST elevations to indicate a myocardial infarction. The QRS complexes are narrow. There's no consistent pattern of blocked P waves to suggest 3rd-degree AV block.",False,B,"IT0006, B

1,IT0007,Il paziente presenterà probabilmente:,C,True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL. These findings are consistent with an anterior STEMI, which is caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The ST elevation in V1-V6 suggests involvement of the anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle, supplied by the LAD. The ST elevation in I and aVL confirms lateral wall involvement. Therefore, the patient is likely to present with occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.",True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: I cannot answer this question accurately. The question requires analysis of an image which is missing. However, judging solely from the text of the question and the potential answers, without the image, the question appears to be about a medical diagnosis related to heart condition (likely an ECG reading). Option C, ""Occlusione della discendente anteriore"" translates to ""Occlusion of the anterior descending [artery]"", which implies a heart attack, which is plausible given the medical context and is a more common issue than Pneumothorax. Therefore, while I cannot be certain, I choose option C.",True

Reasoning: The clinical scenario describes an elderly patient with a history of stroke and diabetes, on multiple medications, presenting with widespread urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear bullae and intense itching. The image shows tense bullae on an erythematous base. This presentation is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid.
Pemfigo volgare would typically present with flaccid bullae that rupture easily, leading to erosions. Herpes zoster presents with a dermatomal distribution. Contact dermatitis would be localized to the area of contact with the allergen or irritant. Impetigo bullosa typically presents with superficial bullae that rupture easily, forming crusts, and is more common in children. Thus, based on the clinical and image characteristics, bullous pemphigoid is the most probable diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy. He presents with widespread urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled bullae. The lesions are intensely pruritic. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is a common autoimmune blistering disease in the elderly, often presenting with prodromal urticarial plaques before the development of bullae. The tense bullae and intense itching are also characteristic features. While other options could present with blisters, the clinical context is more consistent with bullous pemphigoid.
Pemfigo volgare usually presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement, which is not described in this case. Herpes zoster typically presents with a dermatomal distribution and is often painful, not pruritic. Contact dermatitis is less likely to present with tense bullae and the distribution would be related to the contact. Impetigo bullosa is caused by bacterial infection and generally presents with superficial fragile bullae, more common in children.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear-filled bullae, which are intensely pruritic. This clinical presentation suggests a bullous disease. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence, searching for anti-basement membrane antibodies. This is because bullous diseases often involve antibodies against the basement membrane zone or other structures in the skin. The other options are less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis for this presentation: A focuses on celiac disease, C on dermatoscopy, D on Tzank smear for viral infections (which is less likely given the chronic evolution), and E on pemphigus, which is less likely given the description of urticarial plaques. Thus, B is the most appropriate first step.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense bullae with clear content and intense pruritus. This clinical picture suggests a bullous dermatosis. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure would be a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to identify the specific antibodies and the level of blister formation. The search for anti-basement membrane antibodies is important in the differential diagnosis of bullous dermatoses, such as bullous pemphigoid. Option A is related to celiac disease diagnosis. Option C (dermatoscopy) and D (Tzank smear) are not the first-line diagnostic tools for bullous dermatoses. Option E focuses on desmoglein antibodies, which are more relevant to pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus.",True

Reasoning: The question asks about quantifying the association between the disease (esophageal cancer) and the risk factor (alcohol consumption) in a case-control study. In case-control studies, the appropriate measure of association is the Odds Ratio (OR). The formula for the OR, based on the table in the image, is (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of exposed cases (656), 'b' is the number of unexposed cases (214), 'c' is the number of exposed controls (516), and 'd' is the number of unexposed controls (386). Therefore, the OR is (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). Option C provides the correct formula. Options A and E refer to Risk Difference, and option B is the Risk Ratio, and option D is incorrect.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association between a risk factor and a disease is the Odds Ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (number of exposed cases * number of unexposed controls) / (number of unexposed cases * number of exposed controls). From the prompt, the numbers provided are likely related to the exposed and unexposed groups among the cases and controls. Option C, OR: (656 · 386) / (516 · 214), represents the formula for calculating the odds ratio in a case-control study, using the provided numbers. RA stands for risk attributable, RR stands for relative risk. Risk attributable and relative risk should only be used in cohort studies, not in case control studies.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are retrospective and typically less expensive and faster to conduct than cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. They are good for studying rare diseases. You can't calculate incidence or prevalence from a case-control study because the proportions of cases and controls are determined by the researchers, not by the actual occurrence of the disease in the population. Therefore, option A is correct.
While the image provides data that could be analyzed within the context of the case-control study described in the question, it does not directly factor into determining the inherent advantages of case-control studies themselves. This is because the advantages of the case-control study is based on it's study design.
Therefore, based on the advantages of the case-control studies alone, the correct answer is A.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and faster to conduct than cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. They are useful for studying rare diseases or diseases with long latency periods. The other options are incorrect because case-control studies do not allow for the direct calculation of incidence or prevalence.",True

The ECG findings do not support pericarditis or prior MI.",False,C,"IT0063, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. This pattern is consistent with an inferior STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's presentation of epigastric pain, along with hypotension and bradycardia, further supports this diagnosis. The ST depression in aVL is reciprocal change often seen in inferior MI.",True

Reasoning: The patient is presenting with epigastric pain, hypotension and bradycardia. The ECG shows a possible inferior STEMI, in particular the ST elevation in II, III and aVF and reciprocal ST depression in V1, V2. Given this situation, Ticagrelor is indicated for antiplatelet therapy. The patient is already hypotensive, so Nitroprussiato should be avoided. Diltiazem is not indicated given bradycardia. Warfarin is not an acute treatment and Enalapril is contraindicated.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, low blood pressure (90/50 mmHg), and a slow heart rate (57/min). These symptoms, along with the ECG findings (not provided in text, but inferred from the need to alert the hemodynamics lab), suggest a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or myocardial infarction (MI), complicated by hypotension and bradycardia. Given the situation and while preparing for the patient to go to the catheterization lab, starting Ticagrelor as part of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is appropriate.

Nitroprussiato of Sodium (A) is used to treat hypertension, but this patient has hypotension. Diltiazem (B) is a calcium channel blocker that lowers blood pressure and heart rate, which would worsen the current hypotension and bradycardia. Warfarin (C) is an anticoagulant and is not indicated in the acute setting of a suspected MI. Enalapril (E) is an ACE inhibitor used for hypertension and heart failure, which would worsen the patient's current hypotension.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which indicates an inferior wall myocardial infarction. This type of infarction is most commonly caused by an occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient also presents with hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardia (57/min), which is consistent with the Bezold-Jarisch reflex that can be triggered by inferior MI involving the RCA.

Reasoning: The patient's history of a motor vehicle accident with neurological deficits including being unresponsive, withdrawing from pain, and anisocoria strongly suggests a traumatic brain injury. The CT scan shows a hyperdense (bright) crescent-shaped collection of blood that crosses suture lines, which is characteristic of an acute subdural hematoma.
A) Intraparenchymal hematomas can occur with trauma, but typically appear as localized areas of hemorrhage within the brain tissue itself, not a crescent shape.
B) Chronic subdural hematomas are typically hypodense or isodense on CT, and less likely given the acute presentation.
C) Epidural hematomas are usually lenticular (lens-shaped) and do not cross suture lines.
E) Subgaleal hematomas are collections of blood outside the skull, deep to the scalp, and are not typically seen on a brain CT.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's presentation (unresponsiveness, anisocoria, motor response to pain indicating some level of awareness) following a high-impact trauma such as a motorcycle accident strongly suggests an acute intracranial injury. Among the options, intraparenchymal hematoma is the most likely finding. The other options are less likely given the acute presentation and mechanism of injury: subdural hematomas, particularly acute ones, can occur but are usually associated with different presentations (e.g., gradual decline); epidural hematomas typically have a lucid interval followed by rapid deterioration, and subgaleal hematomas are usually extra-cranial. Since anisocoria is present, an intraparenchymal hematoma causing pressure on one side is most likely.",False

Reasoning: The image shows a sagittal view of the lumbar spine because we can see the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other, the spinal cord running vertically, and the intervertebral discs between the vertebral bodies. This is a classic sagittal view.
A coronal view would show the spine from front to back, and an axial view would show it in cross-section. The oblique planes allow to focus on specific structures like the peduncles or the neuroforamina. In this case, the image is acquired on a sagittal plane.",True,A,"IT0130, A
Reasoning: The image shows a lateral view of the lumbar spine, which is characteristic of a sagittal plane. The bodies of the vertebrae are visible from the side, indicating that it is not a coronal or axial plane. It is a sagittal plane aligned along the midline, and therefore a sagittal plane pure.",True
1,IT0131,[Paziente di 45 anni esegue indagine Risonanza Magnetica della colonna lombare per lombalgia da 2 mesi non responsiva ai farmaci antifiammatori.] Nella RM si rileva una probabile metastasi ossea. Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: Given the MRI findings suggestive of bone metastasis in a 45-year-old patient with persistent low back pain, the most appropriate next step to identify the presence of other bone metastases is a bone scan (scintigrafia ossea). Bone scans are highly sensitive for detecting areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic disease.
CT scans are useful for visualizing bony structures in detail, but a bone scan is more sensitive for detecting early metastatic lesions. A whole-body CT with contrast would expose the patient to a higher dose of radiation and contrast, and is not as sensitive as bone scan. Ultrasound is not the best method for detecting osseous metastases. CT with a low-dose protocol may miss lesions.
Therefore, a bone scan is the most suitable choice to identify potential bone metastases.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate investigation to identify the presence of bone metastases, given that an MRI has revealed a probable bone metastasis in a 45-year-old patient with lower back pain. Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive technique for detecting bone metastases because it highlights areas of increased bone turnover, which are characteristic of metastatic lesions. While CT scans can also detect bone metastases, scintigraphy is generally more sensitive for detecting early lesions. A whole-body CT is not the most appropriate initial investigation. Ultrasound is not helpful for detecting bone metastases. A low dose CT does not have enough resolution for bone metastasis evaluation.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a flattened appearance of the intestinal villi, consistent with atrophy of the mucosa. This atrophy can cause malabsorption, which fits with the symptoms described in the question. The other options (fistulas/abscesses, neoformation, bleeding, ulcer) are not directly apparent from the image.",True,B,"IT0136, B

Reasoning: The patient presents with eritemato-ipercheratosiche lesions, nummular shape at the scapular region. There are also hyperkeratotic lesions and cicatricial alopecia at the vertex of the scalp. The lesions are long-standing, tend to atrophic scarring and leave hyperpigmented results, especially peripherally. They also tend to worsen after sun exposure. This suggests a diagnosis of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE). Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for DLE.
A) nbUVB phototherapy is not typically used in the treatment of DLE, and it can worsen symptoms in some patients.

Reasoning: The description points towards discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE):
- Erythematous-hyperkeratotic lesions on the scapular region.
- Hyperkeratotic lesions with cicatricial alopecia on the scalp.
- Old lesions on the trunk with cicatricial atrophy and hyperpigmentation.

Reasoning: The histological findings of villous atrophy (flattening of the villi), crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes are characteristic features of celiac disease. These findings indicate an inflammatory response in the small intestine due to gluten sensitivity. While non-celiac gluten sensitivity may show some symptoms, it doesn't typically cause such severe histological changes. Whipple's disease involves infiltration with PAS-positive macrophages. Crohn's disease is less likely to present with these specific features diffusely in the small intestine.

Reasoning: The image shows multiple, well-defined, rounded opacities scattered throughout both lung fields, which is a classic presentation of pulmonary metastases (""cannonball"" metastases). The other options are less likely given the appearance. Miliary TB would present with smaller, more uniformly distributed nodules. Pneumonia is generally more localized and would not have the same appearance as discrete, round masses. Atelectasis would appear as a collapsed area of lung, often with volume loss, and would not show multiple rounded opacities.

Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache and vomiting followed by aphasia and right hemiparesis. His medical history includes hypertension and cirrhosis. The examination reveals a soporose patient with global aphasia and right hemiplegia. The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left frontoparietal region, indicating a bleed. This presentation strongly suggests an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Given the history of hypertension, this is likely a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The image confirms a significant bleed on the left side of the brain. A hematoma of the specified type would have a different appearance and location.

Reasoning: The clinical picture (progressive weakness, speech difficulties) and MRI findings (extra-axial lesion, dural tail, homogeneous contrast enhancement) are highly suggestive of a meningioma. The lesion is in the right frontal region, which explains the left-sided motor deficit. The image confirms a well-defined, extra-axial mass. A meningioma arising from the dura is the most likely diagnosis. The location being frontal and the description of the lesion are most indicative of meningioma. Gliomas are typically intra-axial. Metastasis would be less likely to be a single lesion and have a dural tail. Subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal hemorrhage would have different imaging characteristics.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and speech difficulties (expressive aphasia). The MRI reveals an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal region that enhances strongly and homogeneously with contrast, along with dural thickening (""dural tail"").

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **B) Glioma frontale sinistro di alto grado:** Gliomas are intra-axial tumors, not extra-axial. While they can cause neurological deficits, the description of extra-axial location and dural tail are not typical of gliomas. Furthermore the symptoms point to a RIGHT hemispheric problem.
*   **C) Metastasi temporale destra da carcinoma mammario:** While metastases can occur, they often present as multiple lesions and may not have the characteristic dural tail.
*   **D) Ematoma sottodurale acuto fronto-parietale sinistro:** Acute subdural hematomas typically result from trauma and are not described as enhancing homogeneously with contrast or associated with a dural tail. Furthermore, the symptoms point to a RIGHT hemispheric problem.
*   **E) Emorragia intraparenchimale spontanea frontale destra:** Intraparenchymal hemorrhages are usually acute events and wouldn't present with a dural tail or progressive symptoms over months.

Meningiomas are benign tumors arising from the meninges (extra-axial). They often demonstrate strong, homogenous contrast enhancement and are characteristically associated with a dural tail sign. Given the patient's age, location of the lesion (frontal right), the progressive symptoms and the MRI findings of an extra-axial, contrast-enhancing lesion with a dural tail, meningioma is the most probable diagnosis. Expressive aphasia can be caused by lesions of the dominant (usually left) inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) and hemiparesis by lesions in the contralateral (left) motor cortex. In this case the lesion is in the right hemisphere and therefore the aphasia and hemiparesis are explained by compression on the contralateral side from mass effect. Hence a meningioma of the *left* frontal convexity is more plausible than of the right convexity. However, option A refers to *Meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra* which translates to *Meningioma of the LEFT frontal convexity*. All options except A are definitively incorrect. Therefore A is the correct answer.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with thigh pain, predominantly nocturnal, which is relieved by aspirin. This is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. The image shows a sclerotic lesion with a central nidus, which is characteristic of osteoid osteoma. While the image is not of high quality, the clinical information strongly points to osteoid osteoma. Other options are less likely given the clinical picture and image findings. Chondroblastoma typically occurs in the epiphysis of long bones and is not usually relieved by aspirin. Chondrosarcoma is typically a slow-growing tumor that does not respond to aspirin. Osteosarcoma is a more aggressive tumor and would not usually present with pain that is relieved by aspirin. Enchondroma is typically asymptomatic and does not cause pain.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly at night, that is relieved by aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid).

Reasoning: The image shows a chest X-ray with a marked hyperlucency (darker area) in the left hemithorax, with absent lung markings and a visible visceral pleural line. This is characteristic of a pneumothorax. The left lung is collapsed. This condition can be life-threatening if large enough. The other options are less likely given the findings. Cardiomegaly could be assessed, but it's not the most concerning. Emothorax would be a density, not a lucency. Stenosis tracheale is not evident and dissection aortica is usually diagnosed using more specific imaging.",True,C,"IT0340, C
Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows a complete absence of lung markings on the left side, along with a visible visceral pleural line. This is indicative of a left-sided pneumothorax. Pneumothorax can be life-threatening if it's large and causes tension, impairing ventilation and cardiac output. Therefore, pneumothorax is the most dangerous condition among the given choices. Cardiomegaly, hemothorax, tracheal stenosis, and aortic dissection could all be dangerous but in this context, the pneumothorax is the most urgent.",True

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense collection along the convexity of the brain, consistent with an acute subdural hematoma. The hematoma is compressing the brain parenchyma and causing midline shift. Given the patient's history of a motorcycle accident and GCS of 8/15, this is a likely diagnosis. An epidural hematoma typically has a lenticular shape, subarachnoid hemorrhage would show blood within the sulci, intraventricular hemorrhage would show blood in the ventricles and intraparenchymal hemorrhage would show blood within the brain tissue.",True,B,"IT0375, B
Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdensity overlying the brain parenchyma, which is characteristic of an acute subdural hematoma. The shape is due to bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater, hence the ""subdural"" location.",True

Reasoning: A mid-shaft humerus fracture is associated with the radial nerve, which wraps around the humerus. The question asks about the most common immediate complication. Therefore, radial nerve injury is the most likely complication. While brachial artery injury is possible, it is less common. Median and ulnar nerve injuries are associated with fractures closer to the elbow. Pulmonary thromboembolism is not an immediate complication of this type of fracture.",True,C,"IT0390, C
Reasoning: A fracture of the middle third of the humeral diaphysis is most commonly associated with injury to the radial nerve. The radial nerve courses in the spiral groove of the humerus, making it vulnerable to injury in fractures of this area.

Quale è la diagnosi più probabile?",B,True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old male, smoker and hypertensive who recently underwent prostatectomy and presents with dyspnea, hypotension (100/50 mmHg) and hypoxemia (O2 sat 88%).
The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern (prominent S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and inverted T wave in lead III).
These signs are suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism.
While anemia is possible after surgery, it doesn't explain the S1Q3T3 pattern. Heart failure might explain the dyspnea, but the ECG is not typical for hypertensive cardiomyopathy and the hypotension is less common in heart failure. Aortic dissection is also a differential diagnosis in someone with hypertension and sudden dyspnea, but the ECG findings and context are more in line with PE. Brugada syndrome is unlikely given the lack of typical ST-segment elevation in V1-V3.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism.",True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset dyspnea, low blood pressure (100/50 mmHg), and low oxygen saturation (88%). He is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy. These factors, combined with the ECG (which shows sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern - although the image quality is poor, this pattern is suggestive), strongly point towards acute pulmonary embolism. Recent surgery increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism. Hypotension and hypoxemia are also consistent with PE.

A Brugada syndrome would typically present with a characteristic ECG pattern, which is not clearly present in this ECG (given the poor image quality but the pattern of sinus tachycardia is not consistent with that).
C Aortic dissection typically presents with severe chest pain.
D Hypertensive cardiomyopathy would likely lead to a more gradual onset of dyspnea, not sudden.
E Post-operative anemia can cause dyspnea, but the sudden onset and hypoxemia are more consistent with PE. Furthermore, anemia is not typically associated with hypotension.",True

Reasoning: The patient's history includes a fall 4 weeks prior, difficulty walking, speech disturbances, right-sided weakness, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and a CT scan showing a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of a chronic subdural hematoma.

Image B shows CSF as bright (hyperintense) compared to the brain parenchyma. This is characteristic of a T2-weighted image. However, the question asks if image B has contrast or not. Compared to image A, it doesn't. A contrast enhanced T1 image shows enhancement of vessels. Therefore, option E is the most correct. Image A is T1. Image B is T1 with contrast.
Based on the images provided, image A is T1 and B is T1 with contrast. It could also be a FLAIR, however, comparing it with the original T1, the sulci doesn't appear bright, it is more likely a T1 with contrast. This suggests a T1 with contrast.",False,E,"IT0532, E
Reasoning: In T1-weighted images, fluids like CSF appear dark, while in T2-weighted images, fluids appear bright. In image A, the CSF appears dark, suggesting a T1 sequence.

Reasoning: The TC image shows a pneumothorax on the left side. The lung is partially collapsed and there is air in the pleural space, consistent with a pneumothorax. The question states that the patient presented with pain in the left chest (emitorace sinistro) and dyspnea after a sudden movement, which can cause a pneumothorax. The image clearly shows the absence of lung markings in the upper left hemithorax, indicating the presence of free air. The visceral pleura is also visible as a fine line.

Reasoning: The patient is presenting with chest pain, diaphoresis, and neck tightness, suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, which are risk factors for coronary artery disease. The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V4. This is consistent with a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) involving the anterior wall of the left ventricle. Given the clinical suspicion and ECG findings, the next step is emergency coronary angiography (<2h) for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). While troponin levels will likely be elevated, they are not immediately actionable. Angio-CT is not sensitive enough for acute intervention. Inflammation markers are completely irrelevant. Urgent coronary angiography (within 24 hours) would be too late.",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pain, diaphoresis, and a feeling of tightness in the throat (costrizione al giugulo). He also has risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia). The ECG (although not provided) is likely showing ST-segment elevation or other signs of acute myocardial infarction, making emergent coronary angiography (<2h) the most appropriate next step for diagnosis and potential intervention (PCI). While troponin levels are important, waiting for the results would delay potentially life-saving intervention. Angio-CT is not the preferred initial diagnostic test in this setting when emergent intervention is likely necessary. Assessing inflammatory markers and viral antigens/antibodies is not indicated in the context of acute chest pain with high suspicion of ACS. Coronary angiography within 24 hours (option E) is not urgent enough given the clinical presentation.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a fundus with extensive retinal hemorrhages, dilated and tortuous veins, and cotton-wool spots. This presentation is highly suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), particularly given the patient's history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, which are risk factors for this condition. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy would likely present with microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, and potentially some hard exudates. Branch retinal vein occlusion would typically only affect one quadrant. Neovascular AMD would present with subretinal hemorrhage and potentially drusen or other AMD-related findings. Central serous retinopathy wouldn't show such extensive hemorrhages.",True,B,"IT0653, B
Reasoning: The image shows a fundus photograph with widespread retinal hemorrhages, tortuous and dilated veins, and cotton-wool spots. This presentation, coupled with the patient's age (75), history of hypertension, and sudden vision loss, is highly suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The hemorrhages are distributed throughout the retina, indicating the central vein is occluded. The other options are less likely given the fundus appearance: Diabetic retinopathy typically shows microaneurysms and dot-blot hemorrhages. Branch retinal vein occlusion shows hemorrhages in a sector of the retina, not diffusely. Neovascular AMD would typically show subretinal fluid and hemorrhage localized to the macula.

Reasoning: The patient is a 50-year-old diabetic presenting with retrosternal discomfort and nausea, which are concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG shows ST-segment depression in leads V1-V3 and T wave inversion in leads V1-V4. These findings are suggestive of posterior ischemia, which is often associated with inferior or lateral ischemia and may not be readily apparent on a standard 12-lead ECG. Given the clinical presentation and ECG findings, the most appropriate intervention is to admit the patient to a monitored cardiac bed for serial ECGs and troponin measurements to evaluate for ACS and potentially unstable angina or NSTEMI. Options C and D are not warranted, since there is no clear indication of ST elevation MI. Options B and E are inappropriate, since the patients presentation and ECG findings are more suspicious for cardiac etiology.",False,A,"IT0713, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest discomfort, nausea, and a history of diabetes, which are concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG is crucial for determining the appropriate management. Without a clear ECG provided, it is safer to assume the patient needs further evaluation. Hospital admission for monitored cardiac care, repeat ECGs, and troponin testing is the most appropriate initial step to rule out or confirm ACS. Starting aspirin and discharging with follow-up (B) would be premature without a full assessment.

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a fracture through the growth plate (physis) of the proximal humerus. This is a Salter-Harris type I fracture, also known as an epiphysial separation. The patient is 10 years old, which is a common age for this type of injury to occur due to the relative weakness of the growth plate. The trauma from the soccer game is consistent with the mechanism of injury for this type of fracture. Options A, B, C, and E are less likely given the appearance of the radiograph and the patient's age and history.

Image A shows an arthroscopic view demonstrating a meniscal tear, specifically a ""bucket-handle"" tear. Image B confirms the presence of such a tear on MRI. This type of tear causes the symptoms mentioned in the question. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus.",True,E,"IT0785, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with acute knee pain, swelling, a history of a twisting injury after jumping, a locked knee, and limited range of motion (20-90 degrees). These findings are highly suggestive of a meniscal tear, specifically a bucket-handle tear. A bucket-handle tear is a longitudinal tear of the meniscus that displaces into the intercondylar notch, causing mechanical symptoms such as locking. The arthroscopic image (Figure A) will show the tear. The MRI (Figure B) will demonstrate the displaced fragment. The other options are less likely given the clinical presentation.

Reasoning: The patient presents with regurgitation, dysphagia and chest pain, with negative findings on endoscopy and negative cardiac workup. The esophagography reveals a ""bird's beak"" narrowing at the lower esophageal sphincter, which is characteristic of achalasia.
A GIST would likely present as a mass on endoscopy or imaging.
A hiatal hernia can cause similar symptoms, but the esophagography would show the herniated portion of the stomach.
GERD is less likely given the dysphagia.

Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows a complete collapse of the left lung with no lung markings visible, and the mediastinum is shifted to the right. This indicates a massive left pneumothorax, which requires urgent drainage. The patient's clinical presentation (chest pain, tachypnea, reduced breath sounds on the left side), along with the blood gas analysis (hypoxemia, hypocapnia), supports this diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0861, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with left chest pain exacerbated by breathing, tachypnea (34 breaths/min), and decreased breath sounds on the left side. The blood gas analysis shows pH of 50 (likely a typo, it is expected to be near 7, which, with the other values, indicate respiratory acidosis). PaO2 is low (62 mmHg) and PaCO2 is also low (28 mmHg) showing respiratory compensation. The chest X-ray shows a large air collection in the left hemithorax with complete collapse of the lung (pneumothorax).
Given the clinical presentation, respiratory distress, and the large size of the pneumothorax on the X-ray, immediate chest tube insertion is required. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is a massive left pneumothorax requiring urgent chest drainage.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with a morbilliform maculopapular eruption, facial edema, intense pruritus, fever, and had started allopurinol three weeks prior. Lab results show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver enzymes, lipase, and amylase. These symptoms strongly suggest Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. SDRIFE typically involves the intertriginous areas. Dermatite livedoide di Nicolau is an ischemic necrosis of the skin following drug injections. Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) presents with pustules.

Reasoning: The peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells), which are indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA can be caused by various conditions such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Reasoning: The question describes schistocytes in the peripheral blood smear. Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells, and their presence is characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), which includes conditions like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
A) Drepanocytosis (sickle cell anemia) is characterized by sickle-shaped red blood cells.
B) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can cause spherocytes, but not schistocytes.
C) Elliptocytosis causes elliptical shaped red blood cells, not schistocytes.

L’EGDS mostra in sede antrale il quadro riportato. Qual è la diagnosi endoscopica di quanto osservato?,A,True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and anemia, suggesting a gastrointestinal bleed. The EGDS reveals a lesion in the antrum, and the image shows an ulcer with a clean base and a small amount of visible clot or possible pigmentation. Forrest IIc ulcers are defined as ulcers with a flat spot. The characteristics match a Forrest IIc ulcer which is a non-bleeding ulcer with signs of recent hemorrhage. Forrest I ulcers are characterized by active bleeding, while Forrest III ulcers have a clean base with no signs of recent bleeding. A hyperplastic polyp would appear as a raised lesion. Therefore, Forrest IIc is the most likely diagnosis. A diverticulum wouldn't have the features observed in the image.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena (dark stools) and microcytic hypochromic anemia, suggesting blood loss. The EGDS shows an antral finding. Based on the endoscopic appearance in the image, which seems to show an ulcer crater with a dark spot at the base, it is likely an ulcer with a covered vessel (Forrest IIc). Therefore, option A (Ulcera gastrica antrale tipo Forrest IIc) is the most likely diagnosis.",True
1,IT0919,"Un paziente di 56 anni si presenta in Pronto Soccorso con dolore diffuso in zona epigastrica. Appare ansioso, agitato, in cerca di una posizione per alleviare il dolore.

The leucocytosis and hyperglycemia are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, STEMI is the most probable diagnosis.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicating an inferior wall STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction). The patient's symptoms (epigastric pain, anxiety, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting) are also consistent with a myocardial infarction. Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia can also be associated with STEMI.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a brachytherapy technique where an applicator loaded with iridium 192 sources is placed in the vagina and uterus. This is characteristic of intracavitary brachytherapy, where the radiation source is placed within a body cavity. The image also illustrates this technique. Therefore, the correct answer is E.",True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes the placement of an applicator containing Iridium-192 sources within the vagina and uterus. This technique involves placing the radiation source within a body cavity, which is the definition of intracavitary brachytherapy. Interstitial brachytherapy (A) involves placing the radiation source directly into the tissue. External beam radiotherapy (B) does not involve placing any radioactive source within the patient. Radioimmunotherapy (C) uses antibodies to deliver radiation. Intraoperative radiotherapy (D) involves delivering radiation during surgery.",True

Reasoning: The patient is hemodynamically stable (PA 110/65 mmHg, GCS 15/15, SpO2 99%), and the ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia (SVT) consistent with AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia. Adenosine is the first-line treatment for stable SVT to interrupt the re-entrant circuit. Atropine and isoproterenol would be contraindicated in this situation, as they can increase heart rate. Cardioversion would be considered if the patient was unstable. KCl is not indicated in this situation.",True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) due to nodal reentry. Adenosine is the first-line treatment for PSVT. Atropine would be used for bradycardia. Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic agonist and would increase the heart rate further. Cardioversion is generally reserved for unstable patients or those in whom pharmacological interventions have failed. KCl is inappropriate.",True

Sono presenti altre neoformazioni simili, di diametro minore, sia a livello del torace che del collo. Alla dermatoscopia si apprezzano sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee. Quale diagnosi suggeriscono la clinica e la dermatoscopia?",D,True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description and the dermoscopic image strongly suggest pigmented seborrheic keratosis. Key features include the ""comedo-like"" follicular openings (sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici) and pseudo-cysts (pseudo-cisti cornee), and the description mentions that the lesion is raised (rilevata), rough (ruvida), and has increased in size, which is typical of seborrheic keratoses. Although the patient has a history of melanoma, the specific dermatoscopic findings and clinical presentation are more consistent with seborrheic keratosis. Melanoma would require a careful evaluation using the ABCDE criteria and would likely present differently under dermoscopy (atypical pigment network, irregular streaks, etc.). Basal cell carcinoma typically has a pearly appearance and telangiectasias, which are not described. Dysplastic nevi may resemble melanomas, but the presence of pseudo-cysts makes seborrheic keratosis more likely. Squamous cell carcinoma is typically more ulcerated or crusted, which isn't suggested here. The image and description support the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description of the lesion (light brown, rough, increased size) along with the presence of similar lesions, comedo-like openings, and corneal pseudocysts seen on dermatoscopy, strongly suggests seborrheic keratosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the dermatoscopic findings are not typical of melanoma. Basal cell carcinoma, dysplastic nevus, and squamous cell carcinoma have different clinical and dermatoscopic features.",True

Quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with a papulo-vesicular eruption, symmetrical and located on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, intense itching and burning, lack of response to antihistamines, absence of Nikolski's sign, low-titer IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, dermo-epidermal detachment on skin biopsy, and granular IgA deposits at the tips of the dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence. All these findings are characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease. The presence of IgA deposits at the tips of the dermal papillae is a key diagnostic feature. Also, given the patient is celiac makes Dermatitis herpetiformis the most likely diagnosis. The image supports the description of lesions on the extensor surfaces.

Dermatosis a IgA lineare does not show the described immunofluorescence pattern. Pemphigus vulgaris has a positive Nikolski sign. Scabies bollosa does not have the specific IgA deposits. Bullous pemphigoid does not show IgA deposits at the dermal papillae.",True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 40-year-old male with celiac disease presenting with a symmetrical papulo-vesicular eruption on extensor surfaces of the limbs, intense pruritus, and negative Nikolski sign. The blood tests show IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Skin biopsy shows dermo-epidermal separation and granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae. These findings are highly suggestive of Dermatitis Herpetiformis. Dermatitis Herpetiformis is strongly associated with celiac disease.
Dermatosis a IgA lineare typically presents with a linear deposition of IgA along the basement membrane zone. Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with a positive Nikolsky sign. Scabbia bullosa is not a recognized entity and the description doesn't fit classic scabies. Bullous pemphigoid typically presents with linear IgA deposits along the basement membrane zone.",True
1,IT1044,"Una signora di 67 anni con storia di dispnea da sforzo, mai indagata in precedenza e mai sottoposta ad intervento chirurgico toracico, esegue spirometria. Sulla base dei risultati di seguito riportati quale sindrome disventilatoria è più probabile tra le seguenti?",C,True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The spirometry results show a reduced FVC (57% of the reference value) and a reduced FEV1 (60% of the reference value). The FEV1/FVC ratio is 78%, which is within the normal range (65.9-89.5%). The TLC is also reduced (43% of reference value). These findings are consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect. A restrictive defect is characterized by reduced lung volumes (FVC, TLC), with a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio. An obstructive pattern would typically show a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio. The static lung volumes are reduced, not normal. The volumes are not increased. Since there is no bronchodilator test presented, reversibility cannot be determined. Thus, C is the most likely answer.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The question describes a 67-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea who has never been investigated or undergone thoracic surgery. The spirometry results (visible in the image) show reduced FEV1 and FVC, with a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio. This pattern suggests a restrictive ventilatory defect.
A restrictive ventilatory defect is characterized by reduced lung volumes (FVC) while the airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio) may be normal or even increased. Option C, ""Sindrome disventilatoria di tipo restrittivo"" (Restrictive ventilatory syndrome), aligns with these findings. Other options are inconsistent with spirometry results. Therefore, the correct option is C.",True

Viene eseguito un ECG il cui tracciato è riportato qui di seguito. Quale tra i seguenti è il trattamento più adeguato?",C,True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a slow heart rate with wide QRS complexes. This suggests a high-degree AV block, which is likely causing the patient's symptoms (weakness, headache, dizziness). The most appropriate treatment for high-degree AV block is a pacemaker implant. Cardioversion is not indicated as the rhythm is not a tachyarrhythmia. Midodrine is used for hypotension. Stopping the ACE inhibitor might improve symptoms slightly, but it will not treat the underlying AV block. Defibrillation is for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which is not present in the ECG.",True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete AV block (third-degree heart block), indicated by the absence of a relationship between the P waves and the QRS complexes. The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness), indicating the need for treatment. A pacemaker is the definitive treatment for symptomatic complete AV block. Cardioversion and defibrillation are not indicated, as the rhythm is not a shockable rhythm. Midodrine is used for orthostatic hypotension and would not address the AV block. ACE inhibitors can sometimes cause electrolyte imbalances that worsen arrhythmias, but in this case the definitive treatment is a pacemaker.",True
1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association is the Odds Ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (Odds of exposure in cases) / (Odds of exposure in controls). From the table, we have:
- Cases (Malati): 250 exposed, 100 unexposed.
- Controls (Non malati): 150 exposed, 400 unexposed.

Therefore, the Odds Ratio = (250/100) / (150/400) = (250 * 400) / (150 * 100). Option E gives us the inverse, so we have to switch numerator and denominator. The odds of having the disease given the exposure divided by the odds of not having the disease given the exposure is (a/c)/(b/d) = ad/bc, where a=250, b=150, c=100, d=400. Thus, the OR is (250*400)/(150*100). The question asks for the association between MALATTIA (disease) and the exposure so the answer is (250*400)/(150*100).

However, since this is a case-control study, the cases are the diseased, and the controls are the non-diseased. The odds ratio should then be calculated as (exposed cases / unexposed cases) / (exposed controls / unexposed controls) = (250/100) / (150/400) = (250 * 400) / (150 * 100).

Option E is Odds Ratio: (150*400) / (250*100). But it calculates the OR as (Exposed non-malati * Non-esposti malati)/(Esposti malati * Non esposti non malati) = (150 * 100)/(250*400), which is NOT the odds ratio for this case-control study. Option D is Odds Ratio: (250*400)/(150*100), it calculates the OR as (Esposti malati * Non esposti non malati)/(Esposti non malati * Non esposti malati) = (250*400)/(150*100), and this is the correct OR calculation.

The calculation of Odds Ratio in option E is correct.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the correct measure of association is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is calculated as (number of cases with exposure * number of controls without exposure) / (number of cases without exposure * number of controls with exposure). Based on the unseen table, it is safe to assume that 150 represents cases with exposure, 400 represents controls without exposure, 250 represents cases without exposure, and 100 represents controls with exposure. Therefore, the correct formula is (150*400) / (250*100).",False

Reasoning: The CT image shows a filling defect within the pulmonary artery, which is consistent with a pulmonary embolism. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain also support this diagnosis. While other options may present with chest pain, the CT image is highly suggestive of a PE. An aortic dissection would usually show a visible flap within the aorta. Myocardial infarction and myocarditis would present with different imaging findings. Pericardial effusion usually appears as fluid surrounding the heart.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain that worsens with breathing. The question states that chest X-ray and CT scan with contrast were performed. The symptoms and the imaging point toward a pulmonary embolism. The other options are less likely. Myocarditis, pericardial effusion, and myocardial infarction would have different imaging characteristics.

Reasoning: The image shows an angioTC with contrast enhancement of the chest, mediastinal window. The aorta appears enlarged and irregular, with a possible flap inside the lumen. These are signs suggestive of aortic dissection. While pulmonary embolism can cause chest pain and dyspnea, it would typically show filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, which are not obvious in this image. The mediastinal window is not the best to assess lung parenchyma for metastases. There is no obvious mediastinal mass suggestive of thymoma. Superior vena cava syndrome would cause swelling of the upper body and would be associated with obstruction of the superior vena cava, which is not visible in this image. Therefore, aortic dissection is the most probable diagnosis.",False,E,"IT1114, E
Reasoning: The clinical presentation (chest pain and dyspnea) and the angioTC examination suggest a vascular issue. The image (although low resolution) shows a mediastinal window, and the differential diagnosis includes mediastinal masses and vascular pathologies. Given the sudden onset, chest pain, and angioTC examination with contrast, aortic dissection is the most probable diagnosis in this context.",False
