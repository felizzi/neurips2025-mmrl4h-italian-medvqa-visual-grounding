Reasoning: ST-segment elevation is evident in leads V1-V6, as well as I and aVL. This pattern suggests an anterior wall myocardial infarction, which is caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).",True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: Unfortunately, the image provided is completely blank. Therefore, it doesn't offer any information about the patient's condition. Without any supporting details, the most likely cause of chest pain would be an anterior descending occlusion.",True
1,IT0031,"[Paziente uomo di 85 anni, pregresso ictus ischemico, diabetico, in terapia polifarmacologica.

Le lesioni sono intensamente pruriginose.] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy who presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear-fluid-filled bullae. The lesions are intensely pruritic. These features are highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. The presence of tense bullae helps rule out pemphigus vulgaris. The absence of a dermatomal distribution excludes herpes zoster. While contact dermatitis can cause bullae, it typically doesn't present with such widespread urticarial plaques. Bullous impetigo is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus and presents with more superficial and fragile bullae.
The image also shows tense bullae on an erythematous base, which supports the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. Some bullae appear hemorrhagic, which can be seen in bullous pemphigoid.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy. He presents with diffuse erythematous urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae that are intensely pruritic. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, a common autoimmune blistering disease in the elderly.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **B) Pemphigus vulgaris:** Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by flaccid bullae that easily rupture, leading to erosions. These bullae are often painful rather than itchy.
*   **C) Herpes Zoster:** Herpes zoster presents as a painful, unilateral vesicular rash along a dermatome. The description doesn't fit the diffuse and urticarial presentation.
*   **D) Dermatite da contatto:** Contact dermatitis is typically localized to the area of contact with the allergen or irritant. The diffuse nature of the lesions makes this less likely. Also, tense bullae are not typical in contact dermatitis.
*   **E) Impetigine bollosa:** Bullous impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection. The patient's age and history make this less likely than bullous pemphigoid. Plus, it wouldn't typically be as pruritic.",True
1,IT0032,"[Paziente uomo di 85 anni, pregresso ictus ischemico, diabetico, in terapia polifarmacologica.

Le lesioni sono intensamente pruriginose.] Qual è il procedimento diagnostico più appropriato?",B,True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The description points towards a bullous disease. The combination of urticarial plaques followed by tense bullae suggests bullous pemphigoid. Although other bullous diseases are possible, bullous pemphigoid is a more likely diagnosis given the patient's age and medical history. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence, specifically looking for anti-basement membrane antibodies. Options A, C, D, and E are less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis in this scenario. While E is a plausible option for pemphigus vulgaris/foliaceus, the clinical description suggests bullous pemphigoid more strongly. The presence of urticarial plaques supports bullous pemphigoid. Therefore, B is the most appropriate answer. The image shows tense blisters.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear bullae and intense pruritus. This clinical picture suggests a bullous dermatosis. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to identify the specific antibody deposition pattern in the skin. The search for anti-basement membrane antibodies (anti-membrana basale) is crucial to differentiate between different bullous diseases, such as bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita or linear IgA bullous dermatosis.
Option A is related to celiac disease.
Option C (dermatoscopy) can be helpful, but is not the most appropriate initial diagnostic test.
Option D (Tzank smear) is useful for detecting herpes infections (Tzanck cells), not bullous diseases.
Option E is more specific to pemphigus, which is less likely than bullous pemphigoid based on the clinical history. The more generalized search for anti-basement membrane antibodies, coupled with histology is the preferred first step.",True

Reasoning: In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between the exposure and the outcome. The OR is calculated as (a * d) / (b * c), where:
- a = number of cases who were exposed (656)
- b = number of cases who were not exposed (214)
- c = number of controls who were exposed (516)
- d = number of controls who were not exposed (386)
Therefore, the OR is (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). Option C matches this calculation. Options A and E are Relative Risk. Option B is incorrect for relative risk calculation. Option D is an incomplete ratio.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association is the odds ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where a is the number of cases with the exposure, b is the number of cases without the exposure, c is the number of controls with the exposure, and d is the number of controls without the exposure. The question provides that 870 are cases and 902 are controls. The options provide the numbers to be inserted into the OR formula in option C. Therefore, option C is the correct calculation.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and can be completed in a shorter amount of time compared to other types of studies like cohort studies. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because case-control studies start with individuals who already have the disease (cases) and compare them to a control group without the disease, making it impossible to directly calculate incidence or prevalence. These measures are usually derived from cohort or cross-sectional studies.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally advantageous due to their lower cost and shorter duration compared to cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. They are efficient for studying rare diseases or diseases with long latency periods. They do not allow for the calculation of incidence or prevalence.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in the precordial leads (V1-V4), indicating an anterior STEMI. The patient's symptoms (epigastric pain), risk factors (smoker, hypertension), and vital signs (hypotension) further support this diagnosis. While other options might have some overlapping features, the distinct ST elevations in V1-V4 specifically point to an anterior STEMI.",False

Reasoning: The patient is experiencing epigastric pain, is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg), and has bradycardia (57 bpm). The ECG is concerning for a possible inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) given the ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF. Given the suspicion for MI and the fact that the cath lab is being alerted, it is appropriate to start ticagrelor as an antiplatelet agent. Nitroprussiate would further drop the blood pressure, diltiazem would exacerbate the bradycardia and low blood pressure, warfarin is not an acute treatment, and enalapril is an ACE inhibitor the patient is already on which would lower blood pressure as well.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and the ECG (not visible, but implied to show an acute event). Given the clinical context of a 48-year-old hypertensive smoker with chest pain, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is highly suspected. The patient's hemodynamic instability (hypotension) makes the use of nitroprussiate (A), Diltiazem (B) and Enalapril (E) contra-indicated. Warfarin (C) is an anticoagulant with a slow onset of action and is not appropriate in an acute event. Ticagrelor (D) is a P2Y12 inhibitor, an antiplatelet agent used in ACS, and is an appropriate choice to begin while awaiting hemodynamics.",True

This is consistent with right ventricular infarction, which can be caused by proximal RCA occlusion.",True,A,"IT0065, A
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which is indicative of an inferior wall MI. Inferior wall MIs are most commonly caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardia (57/min) further support the possibility of RCA involvement, as these can be signs of right ventricular infarction, often associated with inferior MI.",True

Quale reperto è verosimilmente apprezzabile alla TC?",C,True,D,"IT0095, D
Reasoning: The patient's neurological exam indicates a severe head injury (GCS likely low). The description of anisocoria (unequal pupils, right greater than left) is concerning for increased intracranial pressure and possible herniation. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense lesion along the inner table of the skull, which is indicative of an acute subdural hematoma. Acute subdural hematomas are often associated with traumatic brain injury and can cause significant mass effect, leading to the clinical findings described. Epidural hematomas are typically lenticular shaped, intraparenchymal hematomas are within the brain tissue, subgaleal hematomas are superficial to the skull, and chronic subdural hematomas tend to be hypodense or isodense.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's presentation (closed eyes, no response to verbal or painful stimuli, absent speech, withdrawal from pain, anisocoria) suggests a severe brain injury. Given the mechanism of injury (motorcycle vs. car accident), an intraparenchymal hematoma is the most likely finding on CT scan. Anisocoria (unequal pupils) is also suggestive of increased intracranial pressure, often caused by an intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subsequent mass effect. While subdural or epidural hematomas are possibilities after trauma, the patient's neurological status and the anisocoria make intraparenchymal hemorrhage the most probable finding. Subgaleal hematomas are usually outside of the skull and don't typically cause severe neurological symptoms. A chronic subdural hematoma is less likely given the acute presentation following a recent traumatic event.",False

Reasoning: The radiograph shows that the humeral head is anterior and inferior to the glenoid fossa. This indicates an anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint, which is the most common type of shoulder dislocation. The mechanism of injury described (fall on outstretched hand with arm abducted and extended) is also consistent with an anterior shoulder dislocation.",True,B,"IT0111, B
Reasoning: The patient's symptoms and the mechanism of injury (fall on an outstretched hand with the shoulder in abduction and extension) are highly suggestive of an anterior shoulder dislocation. This is the most common type of shoulder dislocation. The X-ray would confirm the anterior displacement of the humeral head from the glenoid fossa.",True

Reasoning: The image clearly shows a sagittal view of the lumbar spine. We can see the vertebral bodies stacked one on top of another, as well as the spinal cord within the vertebral canal. This is characteristic of a sagittal plane. The image does not appear oblique. Therefore, the best answer is A.",True,A,"IT0130, A
Reasoning: The image shows a side view of the lumbar spine, which is characteristic of a sagittal plane. Specifically, it shows the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other, and the intervertebral discs in between. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Piano sagittale puro.",True

Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks about the most appropriate investigation to identify bone metastases, after an MRI of the lumbar spine showed a probable metastasis. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is a sensitive technique that detects areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic lesions. While CT scans (options B, C, and E) can also detect bone metastases, a bone scan is generally more sensitive for detecting early lesions. Ultrasound (option D) is not a suitable modality for assessing bone metastases. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question describes a patient with lower back pain unresponsive to anti-inflammatory drugs and a possible bone metastasis found on an MRI of the lumbar spine. It asks which test is most appropriate to identify bone metastases. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is a sensitive whole-body imaging technique used to detect areas of increased bone turnover, which are common in bone metastases. While CT scans can also detect bone metastases, a bone scan is generally preferred as an initial screening tool due to its sensitivity and ability to image the entire skeleton.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a gastroscopy. Given the context of malabsorption, and the villous appearance with possible scalloping, it is likely atrophic mucosa. There are no signs of fistulas, abscesses, neoformations, bleeding, or ulcers in the image. Therefore, the most likely deduction is that there is atrophy of the mucosa.",True,B,"IT0136, B
Reasoning: The endoscopic image shows a marked reduction in the number and size of villi. This indicates atrophy of the mucosa, specifically villous atrophy, which is consistent with malabsorption. Options A, C, D, and E are not consistent with the image findings.",True

- Hyperkeratotic lesions with cicatricial alopecia (scarring hair loss).
- Atrophic scarring.
- Hyperpigmentation, especially at the periphery of lesions.
- Worsening with sun exposure (photosensitivity).

Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for DLE.
Phototherapy nbUVB is often CONTRAINDICATED in lupus erythematosus due to photosensitivity.
Calcipotriol is for psoriasis.

Reasoning: The histological findings described (villous atrophy/flattening, crypt hyperplasia, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes) are highly characteristic of celiac disease. Whipple's disease involves macrophages with PAS-positive inclusions. Crohn's disease shows patchy inflammation, granulomas, and fistulas. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not cause villous atrophy.

Reasoning: The X-ray shows multiple well-defined, rounded opacities scattered throughout both lung fields. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases, which often appear as multiple nodules of varying sizes. Tubercolosi miliare typically presents with smaller, more uniformly distributed nodules. Polmonite a focolai multipli would present with more diffuse infiltrates.

Reasoning: The radiograph shows multiple, well-defined, rounded opacities scattered throughout both lung fields. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases. While other options might be considered, the appearance is most characteristic of metastatic disease. The other options are less likely given the distinct, multiple nodular appearances: miliary tuberculosis would present with smaller, more uniform nodules; multifocal pneumonia would have more consolidation or patchy infiltrates; atelectasis would cause volume loss.

Reasoning: The ECG shows a wide QRS complex tachycardia with varying morphologies, indicating polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsades de Pointes). The rhythm changes from smaller to larger QRS complexes, which is characteristic of this arrhythmia. The patient's loss of consciousness is consistent with this life-threatening arrhythmia.",True,E,"IT0213, E

Reasoning: The image shows significant decomposition changes, including skin slippage, marbling, and insect activity (maggots). Rigor mortis typically resolves within 24-36 hours, so ""complete resolution of rigidity"" implies more time has passed. These decomposition signs suggest that several days, specifically 3-5 days, have passed since death. The presence of an ""acre odor"" in the apartment also strongly suggests decomposition. A, D, and E are too long of a time period as these signs are more consistent with a shorter time after death.",True,A,"IT0229, A
Reasoning: The question describes a body found in Sicily on August 13, 2011, at 8 PM. The presence of a strong odor indicates decomposition. The image (although low quality) suggests some degree of decomposition and the text states that the rigor mortis has resolved. Rigor mortis typically resolves within 36-72 hours (1.5-3 days). Given the hot climate of Sicily in August, decomposition would be accelerated. Therefore, 3-5 days is the most reasonable estimate. Option B (less than 24 hours) is unlikely as rigor mortis would not fully resolve in this time frame. Options C, D, and E (a year, a month, or three months) are far too long given the context. Thus, 3-5 days is the most probable timeframe.",True

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a large, well-defined area of hyperdensity in the left fronto-parietal region, consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient's history of hypertension and cirrhosis, along with the sudden onset of headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis, further supports this diagnosis. An epidural hematoma (A) typically has a lenticular shape, while a subdural hematoma (B) is crescent-shaped. Ischemic stroke (D) would typically appear as a hypodense area on CT. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (E) would typically present with blood in the subarachnoid space.",True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis. His history includes hypertension and cirrhosis. The CT scan (as seen in the image) shows a hyperdense area in the left fronto-parietal region, which is consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient's symptoms (aphasia, hemiparesis) correlate with the location of the hemorrhage. Hypertension is a common risk factor for intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The fact that he is soporose further supports the idea that it is not just a small lesion.
An epidural hematoma usually has a lenticular shape on CT scan and is usually associated with trauma.
A subdural hematoma usually has a crescent shape. Subarachnoid hemorrhage usually presents with severe headache and is distributed in the subarachnoid space. Finally, ischemic stroke doesn't typically appear hyperdense acutely on a non-contrast CT scan.",True

Tale esame evidenzia la presenza di una lesione espansiva verosimilmente extra-assiale a livello frontale destro, captante vivacemente e omogeneamente contrasto, associata a ispessimento della dura madre perilesionale (tail durale) (si veda immagine).] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description indicates a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and speech difficulties (expressive aphasia), suggesting a lesion in the left frontal lobe. The MRI reveals an extra-axial, contrast-enhancing lesion in the right frontal region with dural tail, which are characteristic of meningiomas. Given the symptoms stemming from the left hemisphere, but imaging findings in the right, answer A seems the most probable. The symptoms of right arm weakness and aphasia point to a lesion in the left frontal lobe, affecting the motor cortex and Broca's area, respectively. However, the image shows the lesion on the right side and therefore the correct option should be ""Meningioma della convessità frontale destra"", which does not exist. We can only assume the question contains an inversion error and the correct answer should therefore be A.
Option B is less likely as gliomas are generally intra-axial. Option C is unlikely as metastasis in the frontal lobe are not very typical and dural tail is not common. Options D and E are incompatible with the progressive nature of the symptoms and the MRI findings.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and speech difficulties (expressive aphasia). The MRI reveals an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal lobe, with homogeneous contrast enhancement and a dural tail. This clinical and radiological picture is highly suggestive of a meningioma. Meningiomas are typically extra-axial, often enhance vividly and homogeneously with contrast, and exhibit a dural tail. Furthermore, given the right frontal location, this explains the left side weakness and speech issue (expressive aphasia is typically related to frontal lobe).

Option B is less likely because high-grade gliomas are typically intra-axial and have more irregular enhancement patterns. Metastases (option C) are possible but less likely to present with a dural tail. Subdural hematomas (option D) and intraparenchymal hemorrhages (option E) would have different imaging characteristics on MRI. Meningiomas are much more likely to be on the side indicated by symptoms. Meningiomas of the LEFT hemisphere could cause the symptoms described in the question.

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense, predominantly nocturnal thigh pain relieved by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). The imaging shows a small, well-defined lesion in the bone with surrounding sclerosis. This clinical and radiological presentation is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. The pain relief with aspirin is characteristic of osteoid osteoma due to prostaglandin production by the lesion. The imaging findings support this diagnosis. While the other options are bone tumors, their clinical and radiological presentations do not match the provided information as closely as osteoid osteoma does. Condroblastoma usually occurs in the epiphyses of long bones and does not typically respond to aspirin. Condrosarcoma and osteosarcoma are more aggressive tumors and are less likely to be associated with pain relief from aspirin. Enchondroma is a benign cartilaginous tumor, often asymptomatic or causing mild pain, and does not show a strong association with aspirin relief.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly at night, relieved by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin).

Reasoning: The description of the lesions (rose-brown papules sometimes coalescing into plaques, asymptomatic in the perineal region) suggests condyloma acuminatum or other HPV-related lesions. Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgery are all valid treatment options for condyloma acuminatum. Salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used for condyloma acuminatum and might even be contraindicated due to potential immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids.

Reasoning: A mid-shaft humeral fracture is most commonly associated with radial nerve injury due to the nerve's close proximity to the humerus in the spiral groove. The image shows a displaced fracture, increasing the likelihood of nerve impingement or damage. While brachial artery injury is possible, it is less common. Median and ulnar nerve injuries are less likely in this specific fracture location. Pulmonary thromboembolism is a systemic complication, less likely to be an immediate result of the fracture.",True,C,"IT0390, C
Reasoning: The question describes a displaced fracture of the mid-shaft of the humerus.

The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern (S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, inverted T wave in lead III), suggesting a possible pulmonary embolism. While other options might be considered, the clinical presentation and ECG findings are most consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
The ECG doesn't display the specific features of Brugada syndrome (A), aortic dissection (C) would present with severe chest pain, and while heart failure (D) is possible given the hypertension, the acute onset and ECG are less suggestive of this, and anemia (E) wouldn't typically cause these ECG changes. The most probable diagnosis in this context is pulmonary embolism.",True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent a prostatectomy. He presents with sudden onset dyspnea, hypotension (100/50 mmHg), and hypoxemia (SpO2 88%). While the ECG is unreadable, the sudden onset of dyspnea, in the context of recent surgery (increased risk of DVT) and the patient's risk factors, points to acute pulmonary embolism as the most probable diagnosis. The ECG would be reviewed to rule out other causes, but based on the clinical picture, PE is most likely.
A, C, D and E do not fit the clinical features described.
- Brugada syndrome doesn't cause a sudden onset of dyspnea
- Aortic dissection is unlikely without severe chest pain and signs like pulse deficits.
- Cardiac decompensation in hypertensive cardiomyopathy, while possible, doesn't explain the sudden onset.
- Post-operative anemia is unlikely to cause dyspnea of only 5 hours duration with SpO2 of 88% (likely to be much less). Also would have presented with fatigue.",True

Qual è la diagnosi più verosimile, considerando le immagini neuroradiologiche e la storia clinica?",A,True,A,"IT0512, A
Reasoning: The patient's clinical history includes a recent fall with head trauma 4 weeks prior, gradual onset of neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech disturbances), and a history of atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin (anticoagulation). The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso- to hypodense relative to the brain parenchyma. This presentation is highly suggestive of a chronic subdural hematoma. The crescent shape is typical of subdural hematomas, as they follow the contour of the brain. Chronic subdural hematomas appear iso- or hypodense due to liquefaction of the blood over time. The history of trauma, anticoagulation, and gradual symptom onset all support this diagnosis.
An acute subdural hematoma (D) would typically appear hyperdense and develop more rapidly. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (B) would be located within the brain tissue and not have a crescent shape. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (C) would appear in the subarachnoid space and would not have the same shape as the lesion in the picture. Epidural hematoma (E) typically has a lenticular (lens) shape and is often associated with skull fractures, which are not mentioned here.",True,A,"IT0512, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech disturbance, right-sided weakness) after a head trauma 4 weeks prior. He is also on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, increasing the risk of bleeding. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped (semiluna) hematoma that is iso-hypodense compared to the brain parenchyma, which is characteristic of a chronic subdural hematoma. A chronic subdural hematoma can present weeks after the initial trauma as the hematoma slowly expands, causing increasing pressure on the brain. The other options are less likely given the timeframe and CT findings. An acute subdural hematoma would typically appear hyperdense on CT. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage would likely be more localized. Subarachnoid hemorrhage would typically present with severe headache and neck stiffness. An epidural hematoma is less likely in the elderly, and often associated with a lucid interval after the initial trauma, which is not described in this case.",True

Reasoning: In T1-weighted images, fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appear dark. In T2-weighted images, fluids appear bright. In the image A, the CSF appears dark, which means it is a T1-weighted image. In the image B, the CSF appears bright, which indicates it is a T2-weighted image. Furthermore, since the question states the patient underwent an MRI with contrast, this likely explains the brighter appearance of the image A compared to standard T1. Therefore, Immagine A is a T1-weighted image with contrast and Immagine B is a standard T2-weighted image. Option E is the correct answer.",False,E,"IT0532, E
Reasoning: In T1-weighted images, fluids (like CSF) appear dark. In T2-weighted images, fluids appear bright. In image A, the CSF is dark, so it is a T1-weighted sequence.

Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden left chest pain and dyspnea after a sudden movement. The initial radiography was inconclusive, prompting a CT scan. The CT scan shows a collapsed lung on the left side (pneumothorax).
The question asks for the diagnosis based on the CT scan. Options B and D refer to the right side, which is not indicated in the clinical picture. Option C indicates a pleural effusion which is a collection of fluid, and while possible, the acute onset after a sudden movement points towards a pneumothorax.

Reasoning: The ECG shows absent P waves, irregular R-R intervals, and fibrillatory waves, all indicative of atrial fibrillation. The QRS complexes are narrow, indicating that the impulses are conducted through the normal ventricular conduction pathway. The patient's history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a condition that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation, further supports this diagnosis.

Reasoning: The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pain, diaphoresis, jugular constriction. The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6, indicating an anterior STEMI. Given this high suspicion for STEMI, the immediate next step is emergency coronary angiography (<2 hours) for potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Option A, Angio-CT, is not the primary choice in an acute STEMI scenario where time is critical. Option B, troponin levels, are helpful but delay definitive treatment. Option C is irrelevant in the context of an acute STEMI. Option E, urgent coronarography within 24 hours, is not timely enough given the STEMI diagnosis and need for rapid reperfusion.",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pain, diaphoresis, and a feeling of constriction in the throat. The patient is also hypertensive and dyslipidemic, which are risk factors for coronary artery disease. Given these factors, the most appropriate next step is urgent coronary angiography to assess for coronary artery occlusion and potentially perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Given the severity of symptoms and the suspicion for an acute event, the angiography should be performed as an emergency (<2 hours). Option A is less appropriate because if there is a suspicion of ACS then the first step should be coronary angiography. The troponin levels can confirm the ACS but angiography should be done first. Options C is not appropriate because this step does not help diagnose or treat the most likely condition. Finally, performing the angiography within 24 hours is too long, it should be done in less than 2 hours.",True

Reasoning: The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, dilated and tortuous veins, and optic disc edema. This is highly suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The patient's age, cardiovascular risk factors (cardiopatia, ipertensione), and sudden vision loss further support this diagnosis. Retinal hemorrhages are seen in all four quadrants of the retina.
The other options are less likely:
A) Retinopatia diabetica non proliferante: Microaneurysms and dot-blot hemorrhages are characteristic but not the widespread hemorrhages as seen in CRVO.
C) Occlusione venosa di branca: Hemorrhages would be limited to a sector of the retina, drained by the occluded vein.
D) Degenerazione maculare neovascolare legata all'età: Features include drusen, pigmentary changes, and possibly subretinal fluid or hemorrhage in the macular region, not widespread hemorrhages.
E) Retinite sierosa centrale: Characterized by serous detachment of the macula, usually in younger patients.

Reasoning: The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, dilated and tortuous veins, and cotton-wool spots. This presentation, in a 75-year-old hypertensive patient with sudden vision loss, is highly suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The other options are less likely given the widespread hemorrhages. While diabetic retinopathy can cause hemorrhages, they are usually not as widespread as seen here without other signs like microaneurysms and exudates, which are not clearly visible.

Reasoning: The symptoms described (acute knee pain and mild swelling after a twisting injury, feeling of knee locking, limited range of motion (20-90 degrees)) are highly suggestive of a meniscal tear. The phrase ""lesione a manico di secchio"" translates to ""bucket handle tear,"" which is a specific type of meniscal tear known to cause mechanical blockages and limited range of motion in the knee. The images A and B are consistent with a meniscus tear. The anterior-medial arthroscopic view shows likely damage in that compartment. MRI confirms the diagnosis.

Given the patient's clinical presentation (tachypnea, hypoxemia) and the size of the pneumothorax on the chest X-ray, urgent chest tube placement is warranted. The pH is quite acidotic, so this is most likely not the right value. PaO2 62 mmHg is very low on room air, and PaCO2 28 mmHg suggests hyperventilation compensating for the hypoxemia. Therefore, a large left pneumothorax requiring urgent drainage is the most likely diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0861, A
Reasoning: The clinical presentation includes left-sided chest pain exacerbated by breathing, tachypnea, reduced breath sounds on the left, and hypoxemia with respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.50, PaO2 62 mmHg, PaCO2 28 mmHg). The chest X-ray shows a large radiolucent area on the left side with absence of lung markings, indicating a large pneumothorax. Given the size and the patient's respiratory distress, urgent chest tube drainage is warranted.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with diffuse pruritus that is worse at night, papules, excoriations, scratch marks, and linear lesions on the side of the finger with a papule at one end. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of scabies. The linear lesions are consistent with scabies burrows. The image confirms these lesions. While the other options could present with pruritus, the specific description of the lesions on the finger is more indicative of scabies than the other options. Pediculosis is less likely because there is no head involvement described. Urticaria typically presents with wheals. Bullous pemphigoid presents with large, tense bullae. Cutaneous leishmaniasis presents with ulcerated skin lesions.",True,E,"IT0890, E
Reasoning: The key symptoms are diffuse itching that is worse at night, papules, excoriations, scratch marks, and linear lesions of about 1 cm with a small papule at one end, especially on the side of the finger. These are classic signs of scabies. Pediculosis would involve the head (which is negative). Urticaria presents as wheals and flares, not linear lesions. Bullous pemphigoid presents as large blisters. Cutaneous leishmaniasis would typically present as a localized ulcer.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a peripheral blood smear showing schistocytes. Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells, which are characteristically seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). Therefore, the correct answer is E. Drepanocytes are sickle cells, seen in sickle cell anemia. Elliptocytes are elliptical red cells, seen in elliptocytosis. Macro-ovalocytes are large oval red cells, typically seen in megaloblastic anemia. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can cause spherocytes and possibly some fragmentation, but the primary finding would not be schistocytes as shown in the image.",True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The question describes the presence of schistocytes on a peripheral blood smear. Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells, and their presence is indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is a condition characterized by damage to red blood cells as they pass through small blood vessels, leading to fragmentation. The other options are less likely to be associated with schistocytes:
- Drepanocitosi (sickle cell anemia): typically shows sickle cells.
- Anemia emolitica autoimmune (autoimmune hemolytic anemia): usually shows spherocytes.
- Ellissocitosi (elliptocytosis): shows elliptical red blood cells.
- Macro-ovalocitosi (macro-ovalocytosis): shows large oval red blood cells.",True
1,IT0908,Un paziente di 85 anni giunge all’ambulatorio di Endoscopia Digestiva per eseguire una esofagogastroduodenoscopia (EGDS) in seguito a riferita emissione di feci scure con riscontro agli esami ematochimici di anemia (Hb:8 g/dL) ipocromica microcitica. L’EGDS mostra in sede antrale il quadro riportato. Qual è la diagnosi endoscopica di quanto osservato?,A,True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient has melena and anemia, suggesting upper GI bleeding. The EGDS shows an antral ulcer with a clean base with some dark spots suggesting non-bleeding visible vessel, so it is classified as Forrest IIc. Forrest I means active bleeding, Forrest III is ulcer with clean base. Polipo is not a good option here. Diverticula are unlikely to be single in gastric antrum and also don't explain melena.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and anemia, suggesting an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The endoscopy reveals an antral finding. The image (though unclear) shows a lesion consistent with an ulcer. Forrest IIc indicates a flat spot in the ulcer base. This is consistent with the image and patient presentation. Therefore, Forrest IIc is the most appropriate diagnosis.",True

Elevated blood glucose level and leukocytosis can also be present. While awaiting the enzyme markers, the ECG confirms the emergent need for reperfusion therapy.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in multiple leads. The patient presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and ECG changes suggestive of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Come si definisce quest’ultima tecnica di trattamento?",E,True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes the placement of an applicator with iridium-192 sources into the vagina and uterus. This is characteristic of intracavitary brachytherapy, where radiation sources are placed within a body cavity to deliver radiation to a nearby tumor. Interstitial brachytherapy involves placing the radiation sources directly into the tissue, which is not described here. External beam radiation is delivered from outside the body, which is also not the case. Radio-immunotherapy is a different type of treatment, and intraoperative radiotherapy is performed during surgery. The image further confirms the use of an applicator inside the cavity.",True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes a brachytherapy procedure where an applicator loaded with Iridium-192 is placed within the vagina and uterus. This means the radiation source is placed within a body cavity, which defines intracavitary brachytherapy.",True

Alla luce del quadro ECG e dei parametri vitali quale tra i seguenti è l’intervento terapeutico più appropriato?",E,True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The first-line treatment for stable SVT is adenosine. Cardioversion is used in unstable patients. Atropine and Isoproterenol are not used to treat SVT and KCl would be dangerous. The patient is hemodynamically stable with BP 110/65 and SpO2 99%, so adenosine is the most appropriate choice.",True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient is experiencing paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). While cardioversion is an option, adenosine is the first-line treatment for PSVT. Atropine and Isoproterenol are generally used for bradycardia, and KCl is not indicated in this situation. Adenosine works by slowing conduction through the AV node, which can terminate the re-entrant circuit causing the tachycardia.",True
1,IT1022,"Un uomo di 73 anni, seguito per un pregresso melanoma del dorso, presenta ad un controllo programmato una neoformazione della regione sottoclavicolare destra, nettamente aumentata dall’ultimo controllo, di circa 3 cm di diametro, rilevata, di colore marrone chiaro, ruvida al tatto. Sono presenti altre neoformazioni simili, di diametro minore, sia a livello del torace che del collo. Alla dermatoscopia si apprezzano sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee. Quale diagnosi suggeriscono la clinica e la dermatoscopia?",D,True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description mentions ""sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee"" which are dermatoscopic findings suggestive of seborrheic keratosis. The image also supports this diagnosis. The patient has multiple lesions that are slightly elevated, pigmented, and have a ""stuck-on"" appearance. The dermoscopy image shows features consistent with seborrheic keratosis like comedo-like openings. Melanoma is less likely due to the presence of multiple lesions and the specific dermatoscopic features. Basal cell carcinoma usually presents with telangiectasias and a pearly appearance, not described here. Dysplastic nevi would have irregular borders and pigment network, also not specified. Squamous cell carcinoma presents as a rapidly growing nodule, often with ulceration, which is inconsistent with the slow growth described. Therefore, pigmented seborrheic keratosis is the most probable diagnosis.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description points towards seborrheic keratosis. The key features are: the patient's age, the location of the lesions (chest and neck), the appearance (light brown, rough), the presence of multiple similar lesions, and the dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudocysts. While a melanoma is a possible concern given the history, the dermatoscopic findings are more characteristic of seborrheic keratosis. Basal cell carcinoma typically presents with a pearly appearance and telangiectasia. Dysplastic nevi are usually smaller and less raised. Squamous cell carcinoma is more likely to present with ulceration or scaling. Pigmented seborrheic keratosis matches the description well.",True
1,IT1023,"Maschio di 40 anni, celiaco, si presenta all’osservazione con un’eruzione papulo-vescicolosa, simmetrica che si localizza preferenzialmente alle superfici estensorie degli arti. Il paziente riferisce intenso prurito e bruciore per il quale non ha trovato giovamento da una terapia con antistaminico per os prescritta dal Medico di Medicina Generale. Il segno di Nikolski è assente. Agli esami ematici si riscontrano anticorpi IgA anti-transglutaminasi epidermica (TG3) e anti-transglutaminasi tessutale a basso titolo. Viene eseguita una biopsia della cute che evidenzia uno scollamento dermo-epidermico alla microscopia ottica e, all’immunofluorescenza diretta, depositi granulari di IgA situati all'apice delle papille dermiche. Quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 40-year-old male with celiac disease presenting with a symmetrical papulo-vesicular eruption primarily on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, accompanied by intense pruritus and burning. The patient has not responded to antihistamines. The Nikolski sign is absent. Blood tests show low titers of IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase. Skin biopsy reveals dermo-epidermal separation and granular IgA deposits at the tips of the dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence.
These clinical and pathological findings strongly suggest Dermatitis Herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease and characterized by IgA deposits in the dermal papillae.
The other options are less likely:
- Dermatosi a IgA lineare is typically associated with linear IgA deposition, not granular.
- Pemfigo volgare and Pemfigoide bolloso are autoimmune blistering diseases associated with IgG antibodies, and Nikolski sign is often positive in pemphigus vulgaris.
- Scabbia bollosa is a rare variant of scabies characterized by bullous lesions, but the biopsy and immunofluorescence findings do not align with scabies.
Therefore, based on the combination of clinical presentation, association with celiac disease, and specific immunofluorescence findings, Dermatitis Herpetiformis is the most probable diagnosis. The image further supports this diagnosis showing lesions located on the extensor surfaces.",True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The description points strongly to Dermatitis Herpetiformis:
- 40-year-old male with celiac disease.
- Symmetric papulo-vesicular eruption, preferentially on extensor surfaces of limbs.
- Intense pruritus and burning.
- No improvement with oral antihistamines.
- Negative Nikolski sign.
- IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (low titre).
- Dermo-epidermal separation on biopsy.
- Granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence.

All of these are characteristic of Dermatitis Herpetiformis.
Dermatosis a IgA lineare can have similar presentation but the immunofluorescence pattern is linear.
Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigoid have different presentations, antibodies and immunofluorescence patterns.
Scabbia bollosa is not a specific entity and does not fit the clinical presentation.",True
1,IT1044,"Una signora di 67 anni con storia di dispnea da sforzo, mai indagata in precedenza e mai sottoposta ad intervento chirurgico toracico, esegue spirometria. Sulla base dei risultati di seguito riportati quale sindrome disventilatoria è più probabile tra le seguenti?",C,True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The spirometry results show a decreased FVC (57% of predicted) and a normal or near-normal FEV1/FVC ratio (85%). This pattern is characteristic of a restrictive ventilatory defect. Although the TLC is also reduced to 43% of reference, FVC and FEV1/FVC ratio are more critical for differential diagnosis.
The FEV1 is also decreased to 60% of reference. It is important to consider both the FEV1/FVC ratio and the FVC value. FEV1/FVC is actually the critical value. If FEV1/FVC decreased, then obstructive disease is present. If not, then the next parameter you should look at is the FVC. If it decreased, that would point to restrictive disease. So in this case, FEV1/FVC ratio is not significantly changed and FVC decreased. Therefore the answer is restrictive.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The question describes a 67-year-old woman with dyspnea on exertion who undergoes spirometry. The spirometry results show a restrictive pattern. This can be identified by looking at FEV1/FVC ratio (which is >0.7) and an FVC significantly below the lower limit of normal. A restrictive ventilatory defect is the most likely diagnosis.",True
1,IT1053,"Una paziente di 68 anni, con storia di ipertensione arteriosa e ipercolesterolemia in buon compenso farmacologico con ACE inibitore e statina, riferisce da alcuni giorni debolezza, cefalea e vertigini. Viene eseguito un ECG il cui tracciato è riportato qui di seguito. Quale tra i seguenti è il trattamento più adeguato?",C,True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a slow ventricular rate with P waves not consistently related to the QRS complexes (likely complete heart block or third-degree AV block). The patient has symptoms of weakness, headache, and dizziness, suggesting the bradycardia is symptomatic. The most appropriate treatment for symptomatic complete heart block is a permanent pacemaker implantation.
Cardioversion is used for arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
Midodrine is an alpha-agonist used to treat orthostatic hypotension.
Stopping the ACE inhibitor is unlikely to resolve the heart block.
Defibrillation is for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation.",True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows complete heart block (AV block III degree). The treatment for complete heart block is pacemaker implantation. Cardioversion is used for tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist used to treat orthostatic hypotension. Defibrillation is used for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. ACE inhibitor suspension is not indicated in this case based on the ECG.",True
1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: Since this is a case-control study, we use Odds Ratio to measure the association. The Odds Ratio is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where a is the number of exposed cases (250), b is the number of unexposed cases (100), c is the number of exposed controls (150), and d is the number of unexposed controls (400).  Therefore, the correct formula is (250*400)/(150*100). Option E, Odds Ratio: (150*400) / (250*100) is incorrect. However, based on the table, Odds Ratio should be (250*400) / (100*150), which is equivalent to (250*400) / (150*100). So the option containing Odds Ratio is the one. Option D and E are Odds Ratio calculations. Option D calculates it wrongly as (250*400) / (150*100). Option E has it the other way round, which is incorrect. However, reading the numbers as being in the other order, the formula is then (150*400)/(250*100). So the question must have mixed up the columns of Exposed/Non exposed. So given the table in the image, E is correct.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between a disease and a risk factor in a case-control study. In a case-control study, we calculate the Odds Ratio. Looking at the image, the table is as follows (reading the table rows, from left to right):
Row 1: Disease + Risk factor -> 150
Row 1: Disease + No Risk factor -> 250
Row 2: No Disease + Risk factor -> 400
Row 2: No Disease + No Risk factor -> 100

The Odds Ratio is calculated as (Disease+ and Risk factor+ * Disease- and Risk factor-) / (Disease+ and Risk factor- * Disease- and Risk factor+), which corresponds to (150*100) / (250*400). So, Odds Ratio: (150*100) / (250*400). The correct answer would be the opposite of what is written in option D. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.",False
1,IT1113,Una donna di 73 anni giunge in Pronto Soccorso per dispnea e dolore toracico che peggiora durante la respirazione. Esegue Rx torace ed un approfondimento mediante TC torace con mdc. Qual è la diagnosi più probabile in base ai reperti mostrati negli studi di imaging?,C,True,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The CT scan shows an intraluminal filling defect in the pulmonary arteries, which is consistent with pulmonary embolism. The patient's symptoms (dyspnea and chest pain that worsens during breathing) are also suggestive of pulmonary embolism.
The X-ray on the left may suggest some volume overload (possible heart failure), which could be a result of the pulmonary embolism causing right heart strain.
Other options are not consistent with the imaging findings:
- Miocarditis and Myocardial Infarct would show changes in the heart.
- Pericardial effusion would show fluid around the heart.
- Aortic dissection would show a flap in the aorta.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The question describes a 73-year-old woman presenting with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. The question states that imaging studies include chest x-ray and CT angiography. This clinical presentation, along with the chest pain worsening with respiration and the use of CT angiography, strongly suggests pulmonary embolism. The prompt asks about the most probable diagnosis based on imaging, thus embolia polmonare acuta is the answer.",False

Reasoning: The angioTC image with mediastinal window shows a possible dissection of the aorta. We can see an intimal flap and two different lumina within the aorta. Given the patient's symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea, aortic dissection is the most probable diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism might be considered, however we don't see filling defects in the pulmonary arteries. Other options are less likely to present this way.",False,E,"IT1114, E
Reasoning: The image shows a mediastinal window CT scan of the chest. Given the clinical presentation of chest pain and dyspnea, and the imaging showing a widened mediastinum, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection. The other options are less likely to present with this combination of symptoms and imaging findings. Pulmonary embolism (A) would be better visualized with a pulmonary angiogram. Hemorrhagic thymoma (B) or multiple lung metastases (C) are less likely with the given acute presentation. Superior vena cava syndrome (D) would likely show distended neck veins and facial swelling.",False

Esegue TC Cranio senza mdc che evidenzia un ematoma subdurale destro. Quale dei seguenti aspetti di imaging è tipico dell’ematoma subdurale?,D,True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: An acute subdural hematoma typically appears as a crescent-shaped (or ""falx-shaped"") collection of blood that conforms to the inner surface of the skull, crossing suture lines. In contrast, an epidural hematoma typically appears as a biconvex lens shape. The image confirms the falx shape, extending over a wide area. ""Sole radiante"" is related to meningioma, ""sale e pepe"" to Parkinson's. ""Lente biconvessa"" is typical of epidural hematoma.
Since the question is about ""tipico"" I must look for the one characteristic that clearly defines the pathology.",True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura and the arachnoid membrane. Due to this location, subdural hematomas typically spread thinly and widely across the brain's surface, creating a crescent-shaped appearance on CT scans. This crescent shape is often described as resembling a ""sickle"" or ""falce"". Epidural hematomas, in contrast, typically have a lenticular (biconvex lens) shape because they are limited by the sutures of the skull.",True
