Reasoning: The ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with absent P waves and fibrillatory waves, which are characteristic findings of atrial fibrillation. The QRS complexes are narrow and the ventricular rate is rapid. There are no signs of ST elevation or depression to suggest myocardial infarction, and the PR interval is not prolonged to suggest heart block.
Specifically, note:
- Absence of discernible P waves.
- Irregularly irregular R-R intervals.

Reasoning: The patient is elderly (85 years old), has a history of stroke and diabetes, and is on multiple medications. The description mentions the appearance of diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear-filled bullae that are intensely pruritic. The image confirms tense bullae on an erythematous base. This clinical presentation is most consistent with bullous pemphigoid, a relatively common autoimmune blistering disease in the elderly. Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement. Herpes zoster presents with a dermatomal distribution of vesicles. Contact dermatitis would not typically have tense bullae. Bullous impetigo is more common in children and has superficial bullae with a honey-colored crust. Given the age, bullous lesions, and pruritus, bullous pemphigoid is the most likely diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy. He presents with widespread erythematous, urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae that are intensely pruritic. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, a common autoimmune blistering disease in the elderly. The age of the patient, the urticarial plaques preceding the bullae, and the intense pruritus are all consistent with bullous pemphigoid. Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae and erosions of the skin and mucous membranes. Herpes Zoster is a localized vesicular eruption in a dermatomal distribution, which is not described in the case. Contact dermatitis usually involves a history of exposure to an irritant or allergen and presents with eczematous lesions. Bullous impetigo is a bacterial infection, typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and presents with superficial bullae.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with tense, clear blisters arising on erythematous, urticarial plaques, accompanied by intense itching. Given the clinical presentation, Bullous Pemphigoid is a strong possibility. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to look for antibodies against the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Option A relates to celiac disease. Option C and D are less informative. Option E focuses on desmoglein antibodies, more relevant for pemphigus vulgaris, which typically presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement, not as described. The image confirms tense bullae.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense blisters with clear content, which are intensely pruritic. This clinical presentation suggests a bullous dermatosis. To determine the exact type of bullous dermatosis, a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence is crucial. Direct immunofluorescence is necessary to detect antibody deposition at the basement membrane zone or within the epidermis, which helps to differentiate between various bullous diseases like bullous pemphigoid (anti-basement membrane antibodies) or pemphigus vulgaris/foliaceus (anti-desmoglein antibodies). Option A is related to celiac disease. Option C (dermatoscopy) might provide some clues, but it is not the most appropriate initial diagnostic procedure. Option D (Tzank smear) is mainly useful for detecting viral infections like herpes simplex. Option E is plausible, but less specific than option B.",True
1,IT0053,"[In uno studio caso-controllo per comprendere l'eziologia del cancro dell'esofago, 870 casi e 902 controlli sono stati indagati per quanto concerne il consumo abituale di superalcolici.] L'associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio può essere quantificata calcolando:",C,True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question concerns a case-control study. In case-control studies, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between exposure and outcome. The formula for OR is (a*d) / (b*c) where: a = number of cases with exposure, b = number of cases without exposure, c = number of controls with exposure, and d = number of controls without exposure.
From the table:
a = 656 (Malati Esposti)
b = 214 (Malati Non esposti)
c = 516 (Non malati Esposti)
d = 386 (Non malati Non esposti)

Therefore, OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). Option C is the correct formula.
Options A and E are for risk differences, and option B is for risk ratios. Option D only considers the ratio of exposed cases and controls.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question describes a case-control study. In case-control studies, we cannot directly calculate the risk (RR) or risk difference (RA). Instead, we estimate the association using the odds ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (number of cases with exposure * number of controls without exposure) / (number of cases without exposure * number of controls with exposure).

Based on the problem description, let's denote:
- A: Cases with exposure
- B: Cases without exposure
- C: Controls with exposure
- D: Controls without exposure

The OR is then calculated as (A*D)/(B*C).
In the question text, ""656"" is the number of cases with exposure, ""214"" is the number of controls with exposure. Therefore, the number of cases without exposure is (870-656)=214 and number of controls without exposure is (902-214)=688.

Therefore, the OR should be (656 * (902-214)) / ((870-656) * 214) = (656 * 688) / (214 * 214) or (656 * 386) / (516 * 214).

The question gives total cases of 870 and total controls of 902. ""656"" cases consumed alcohol, hence ""870 - 656 = 214"" cases did not. ""214"" controls consumed alcohol hence ""902 - 214 = 688"" controls did not. Therefore, the correct OR calculation is (656 * 688) / (214 * 214), not (656 * 386) / (516 * 214), since this would require some additional calculations based on unprovided data. However, based on the provided options, option C is closest to the correct expression.

Looking at the options:
A) RA: Incorrect formula.
B) RR: Cannot be calculated in case-control studies.
C) OR: (656 · 386) / (516 · 214). Is close to the correct method of calculating an Odds Ratio.
D) OR: 656/386. Incorrect formula.
E) RA: Incorrect formula.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and quicker to conduct compared to cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. The question asks for an advantage of case-control studies, and the other options refer to calculations of incidence or prevalence, which are not typically directly calculated in case-control studies because the study starts with existing cases. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
The image provides data to potentially calculate odds ratios but does not change the fundamental advantages of a case-control study. The key advantage remains the lower cost and shorter duration.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are retrospective studies that start with identifying cases (individuals with the disease) and controls (individuals without the disease) and then look back to assess prior exposures. A key advantage of these studies is their relative low cost and short duration compared to cohort studies or randomized controlled trials, which would require following a large group of people over a long period. Because the study starts with identifying cases, it is not possible to directly calculate incidence or prevalence from case-control studies.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V4. This indicates an anterior STEMI. The patient's presentation with epigastric pain, hypotension, and bradycardia further support this diagnosis. The ST elevations are most prominent in the anterior leads.
The parameters indicate hypotension and bradycardia. The ECG shows ST elevation in V1-V4, and some in V5. Therefore it is most likely an anterior STEMI.",False,C,"IT0063, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which is indicative of an inferior STEMI.

Reasoning: The patient is a 48-year-old male, smoker, hypertensive on ACE inhibitor therapy, complaining of epigastric pain for about 6 hours. His vitals are concerning for hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardia (57/min). The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF). This is indicative of an acute inferior STEMI. Given the imminent need for hemodynamic intervention, Ticagrelor is the most appropriate immediate treatment to administer while waiting for the cardiac catheterization lab to be prepared as it's an antiplatelet agent. Nitroprussiate is contraindicated due to hypotension. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker and would worsen the bradycardia. Warfarin is an anticoagulant not used in the acute phase of STEMI. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor and would worsen the hypotension.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and is a smoker, hypertensive on ACE inhibitors. The ECG (not provided, but the question explicitly mentions it) most likely shows an acute myocardial infarction (MI) given the scenario. The question asks what should be administered *while* the cath lab (emodinamica) is being alerted.

A) Nitroprussiato di sodio would be contraindicated given the hypotension. It is a vasodilator and would further reduce blood pressure.
B) Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker used for rate control. It could also worsen the bradycardia and hypotension.
C) Warfarin is an anticoagulant that is not used in the acute setting of MI.
D) Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor, an antiplatelet agent used in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). This is an appropriate choice to administer while waiting for the cath lab as it will help prevent further thrombus formation.
E) Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor. Since the patient is already on an ACE inhibitor and is hypotensive, administering another dose is not appropriate.

Given the likely presentation of ACS/MI, antiplatelet therapy with Ticagrelor is the best option to start.",True

Reasoning: The patient has suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) from a motor vehicle accident. The neurological exam indicates a decreased level of consciousness (eyes closed, no opening to verbal or painful stimuli, absent speech), some motor response to pain (withdrawal), and anisocoria (unequal pupils, right > left). Anisocoria in the setting of TBI is concerning for increased intracranial pressure and possible herniation. The CT scan shows a hyperdense (bright) crescent-shaped collection of blood overlying the brain, which is characteristic of an acute subdural hematoma. An epidural hematoma would typically have a lens shape. An intraparenchymal hematoma would be within the brain tissue itself. Chronic subdural hematomas are usually hypodense or isodense. A subgaleal hematoma is superficial to the skull.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient is a 23-year-old involved in a high-impact accident. He is unresponsive (eyes closed, no opening to verbal or painful stimuli, absent speech), but withdraws limbs from painful stimuli. The anisocoria (right > left) is a critical clue pointing towards increased intracranial pressure with possible herniation, likely due to a traumatic brain injury. The most common finding given the trauma and neurological signs would be intraparenchymal hematoma. While other hematomas (epidural, subdural) are possible after trauma, an intraparenchymal hematoma is most consistent with the clinical picture. A subgaleal hematoma is more of a superficial hematoma. A chronic subdural hematoma is less likely in this acute trauma setting.",False

Reasoning: The radiograph shows the humeral head dislocated anteriorly and inferiorly relative to the glenoid fossa, consistent with an anterior glenohumeral dislocation. The mechanism of injury described (fall on an outstretched hand with the shoulder in abduction and extension) is also a common cause of anterior shoulder dislocations. There are no obvious fractures of the greater tuberosity, glenoid or acromioclavicular dislocation on the radiograph. A posterior dislocation would have a different appearance.",True,B,"IT0111, B

Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate investigation to identify the presence of bone metastases after a lumbar spine MRI showed a probable bone metastasis. Bone scintigraphy is a highly sensitive test for detecting bone metastases throughout the entire skeleton, making it more suitable than a CT scan limited to the spine or selective ultrasound. While a CT scan of the entire skeleton with contrast or a low-dose CT scan of the entire skeleton could also detect metastases, bone scintigraphy is generally preferred due to its high sensitivity and ability to detect early bone changes.
The image confirms the presence of possible metastasis.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question describes a patient with lower back pain and suspected bone metastasis found on MRI. The best initial imaging modality for detecting bone metastases throughout the entire skeleton is bone scintigraphy (scintigrafia ossea). While CT can also detect bone metastases, a bone scan is more sensitive for detecting early lesions, especially in cases where the lesions are not causing significant structural changes. Option B is not the best choice since the question asks the most appropriate examination for identifying the presence of metastases across the entire skeleton, not just the spine. Option C specifies contrast which is not necessary for bone metastases, plus a CT of the entire skeleton is more radiation than a scintigraphy. Option D (Ultrasound) is not appropriate to survey the entire skeleton. Option E (low dose CT) would also not be the most sensitive for early detection.",True

Reasoning: The question states that the rigor mortis is completely resolved. Rigor mortis typically resolves within 36-72 hours (1.5-3 days). Option A (3-5 days) is the closest and most reasonable estimate. The information about the date, time, and location (Sicily in August) is relevant to decomposition rates, but primarily to the *rate* of the process; the question explicitly mentions ""complete resolution of rigidity"" which suggests the relevant process (rigor mortis) has already run its course.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis, with a history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis (potentially affecting coagulation). The CT scan (although of low resolution) shows a hyperdense area in the left fronto-parietal region. This strongly suggests an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The symptoms correlate well with the location of the bleed (left hemisphere affecting speech and right side motor function). An epidural hematoma (A) is less likely given the patient's age and the typical mechanism of trauma is missing. A subdural hematoma (B) would present with a different shape on CT. An ischemic stroke (D) usually has a slower onset. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (E) usually presents with a thunderclap headache and the CT scan would typically show blood in the subarachnoid spaces.

Reasoning: The question describes a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and speech difficulties (expressive aphasia). The MRI shows an extra-axial, contrast-enhancing lesion in the right frontal region with a dural tail. This strongly suggests a meningioma. Meningiomas are typically extra-axial, slow-growing tumors arising from the meninges (dura mater). The dural tail sign is a characteristic feature on MRI. Given the location, the symptoms (affecting motor and speech areas), and the MRI findings, a frontal meningioma on the right is the most likely diagnosis. However, since the symptoms refer to the right side of the body and speech difficulties while the suggested answer in option A says ""frontale sinistra"", I will consider the contralateral side. Therefore, the only option which makes sense is A, because the location of the lesion is on the right frontal side in the image.
The dural tail is well visible.
Gliomas are typically intra-axial. Metastases are possible but less likely to present with a dural tail. Hematoma and hemorrhage would have a different appearance on MRI and are unlikely to present with the described progressive symptoms over months. The only reasonable answer is therefore A.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description mentions a slow-progressing weakness in the right arm and speech difficulties (expressive aphasia), indicating a lesion in the left frontal lobe (motor and Broca's area). The MRI shows an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal region that enhances strongly and homogeneously with contrast, along with dural thickening (""dural tail""). These characteristics are highly suggestive of a meningioma, which is typically extra-axial and often demonstrates a dural tail sign due to thickening and enhancement of the dura mater adjacent to the tumor. Because the symptoms relate to left side of brain, then location has to be convex area of the frontal lobe on the left.
Other options are less likely:
- Gliomas are typically intra-axial.
- Metastases often have a different enhancement pattern and may not show a dural tail.
- Subdural hematomas are usually associated with trauma and have a different appearance on imaging.
- Intraparenchymal hemorrhages would appear differently on MRI.
Therefore, meningioma of the left frontal convexity is the most probable diagnosis.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly nocturnal, that responds to acetylsalicylic acid. This is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. The images show a lesion characteristic of osteoid osteoma: a small, well-defined radiolucent nidus surrounded by dense sclerosis. Osteoid osteomas are known to cause pain that is often worse at night and relieved by NSAIDs like acetylsalicylic acid. Other options are less likely given the age and clinical presentation.

Reasoning: The description of the lesions (rose-brownish papules sometimes confluent into plaques) in the perineal region, along with the image, strongly suggests condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgical removal are all valid treatment options for condylomata acuminata.

Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows a clear absence of lung markings on the left side, with a visible visceral pleural line. This is indicative of a left-sided pneumothorax. Pneumothorax can be life-threatening, especially if it is a tension pneumothorax. The other options are less likely given the image findings: cardiomegaly would show an enlarged heart silhouette, hemothorax would show opacification in the pleural space, tracheal stenosis would be difficult to assess on a simple chest X-ray and would require a lateral view or CT, and aortic dissection is possible but less obvious than the pneumothorax in this image.",True

Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy and presents with dyspnea, hypotension (100/50 mmHg), and hypoxia (O2 saturation 88%). The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern. These findings are highly suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Recent surgery is a risk factor for PE. Brugada syndrome typically presents with ST elevation in V1-V3, which is not observed in the ECG. Aortic dissection would present with severe chest pain and possibly widened mediastinum on chest X-ray. Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with heart failure may present with dyspnea but not typically with this sudden onset or the specific ECG changes of S1Q3T3.

Reasoning: The patient's history of a head trauma 4 weeks prior, along with the slow onset of neurological symptoms (difficulty walking, speech disturbances, right-sided weakness), points towards a chronic subdural hematoma. The CT scan description of a crescent-shaped blood collection that is iso-hypodense (meaning it has similar or slightly lower density than the brain tissue) further supports this diagnosis.

Reasoning: The patient's clinical history includes a recent head trauma (4 weeks prior), impaired mobility, speech disturbances, and right-side weakness. The CT scan reveals a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense to the brain parenchyma. This presentation is highly suggestive of a chronic subdural hematoma. The ""chronic"" aspect is supported by the iso-hypodensity on CT, which indicates that the hematoma is not recent and has been present for several weeks. The crescent shape is typical of subdural hematomas because they collect in the potential space between the dura and arachnoid mater. Other options are less likely given the clinical picture and imaging findings. An intraparenchymal hemorrhage would appear within the brain tissue itself. A subarachnoid hemorrhage would typically present with sudden, severe headache. An acute subdural hematoma would likely be hyperdense on CT. Epidural hematomas are typically lens-shaped and associated with skull fractures.",True

Reasoning: In a T1-weighted MRI, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appears dark, while in a T2-weighted MRI, the CSF appears bright. Image A shows dark ventricles, indicating a T1-weighted sequence. Image B shows bright ventricles, indicating a T2-weighted sequence. Since the question mentions resistance to first-line treatments and the need for an MRI, it's plausible to think contrast enhancement was used. Image A does not show contrast enhancement. However, the question does not mention anything about the patient having any lesions so it is not clear if contrast was used. Therefore, the most correct answer would be Image A: T1 sequence and Image B: T2 sequence. However, we need to evaluate if contrast was used, and there is no information to confirm if contrast was used or not in any of the two images. The question asks to ""indicate the correct answer"", and the most correct answer is B, since it describes correctly both sequences. Image A: sequence T2; Image B: sequence T1 with contrast would be incorrect, because it is clear Image A is not a T2 sequence. Therefore the most logical answer is B.",False,E,"IT0532, E
Reasoning: In T1-weighted images, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appears dark, while in T2-weighted images, CSF appears bright.

Reasoning: The patient presents with typical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pain, diaphoresis, and jugular constriction. The ECG shows ST elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4). This indicates an acute STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). In this case, the best course of action is emergency coronary angiography with the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the affected area. This should be performed within 2 hours of presentation. Therefore, D is the most appropriate answer. B could be useful, but it will take too much time. A could be another reasonable option, however given the ECG result, it is better to quickly do the coronarography. C is useless in this acute setting. E is not optimal because it delays the intervention compared to D.",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pain, sweating, and jugular constriction, along with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Given the clinical suspicion of ACS and the likely presence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on the ECG (although the ECG itself is not displayed, the emergency nature of the situation strongly suggests this), the most appropriate next step is emergent coronary angiography (<2 hours) to identify and treat the culprit lesion.

Reasoning: The fundus photograph shows extensive retinal hemorrhages, dilated and tortuous veins, and cotton-wool spots. This is consistent with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The patient's age (75), history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension also increase the likelihood of a CRVO. While diabetic retinopathy could cause similar findings, the sudden onset of vision loss and the extent of the hemorrhages favor CRVO. Branch retinal vein occlusion typically affects a sector of the retina and the fundus photograph shows that hemorrhages are present across all quadrants of the retina. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration does not cause such widespread hemorrhage. Central serous retinopathy would present with a serous detachment, not widespread hemorrhages.",True,B,"IT0653, B
Reasoning: The patient is a 75-year-old with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, presenting with sudden vision loss in the right eye (OD). The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, dilated and tortuous veins, and cotton-wool spots. These findings are characteristic of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). While branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) can present with similar findings, the widespread nature of the changes in the fundus photograph is more suggestive of CRVO. Diabetic retinopathy can cause hemorrhages, but the overall pattern is different, and the patient's history doesn't primarily suggest diabetes. Age-related macular degeneration typically presents with drusen or neovascularization, which aren't prominent in the image.

Reasoning: The patient presents with chest discomfort and nausea, concerning symptoms for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG needs careful evaluation for ST segment changes. While there is no obvious ST elevation, there are some changes in the T waves and subtle ST depression/elevation, specifically in the anterior leads V1-V3 and some reciprocal changes in inferior leads, which might represent an acute coronary syndrome. Given the diabetic history and concerning presentation, the most appropriate intervention is admission to a monitored cardiac bed for serial ECGs and troponin levels to rule out ACS.

I genitori negano precedenti dolori o traumi alla  stessa spalla. La radiograﬁa è mostrata nella ﬁgura. Qual è la diagnosi più probabile fra  le seguenti?,A,True,D,"IT0784, D
Reasoning: The X-ray shows a displacement/fracture at the proximal humeral epiphysis. This is a common injury in children after trauma, especially during sports activities. The age of the patient (10 years old) is also consistent with this type of injury. The physis is the weakest point in the bone and is therefore susceptible to injury. The radiograph shows widening of the growth plate, which is indicative of an epiphyseal fracture. A Salter-Harris type fracture is a fracture that involves the epiphyseal plate or growth plate of a bone. Salter-Harris fractures are classified into five types, with type I being a fracture through the growth plate and type V being a crush injury to the growth plate.
Looking at the X-ray, the fracture appears to be a Salter-Harris Type I or II fracture, involving the growth plate. A Type I fracture extends through the entire growth plate, separating the epiphysis from the metaphysis. A Type II fracture extends through part of the growth plate, then exits through the metaphysis. Both these fractures appear similar on X-ray.
Other options can be excluded because the radiograph does not show signs of clavicle fracture, bone cyst, Ewing sarcoma, or chondrosarcoma.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a proximal humeral epiphyseal separation.",False,D,"IT0784, D
Reasoning: The radiograph shows a fracture through the proximal humeral physis (growth plate). This is common in children after trauma.

Reasoning: The clinical information (acute knee pain, limited range of motion, locking) after a twisting injury is suggestive of a meniscal tear. The arthroscopic image (Figure A) shows a displaced meniscal fragment, which is consistent with a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus. The MRI (Figure B) also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus.",True,E,"IT0785, E
Reasoning: The symptoms of acute knee pain, moderate joint swelling after a twisting injury following a jump, a sensation of knee locking, and a limited range of motion (20-90 degrees) are highly suggestive of a meniscal tear. The phrase ""lesione a manico di secchio"" translates to ""bucket-handle tear,"" which is a specific type of meniscal tear known to cause locking. The arthroscopic and MRI images likely confirm this diagnosis by showing the displaced meniscal fragment. Therefore, option E, ""Lesione a manico di secchio del menisco mediale"" (Bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus), is the most probable diagnosis.

Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive dysphagia, regurgitation (post-prandial and nocturnal), and occasional chest pain, with a negative cardiac evaluation and a negative EGD for neoplastic lesions. The esophagogram is provided. Given the clinical picture and the esophagogram appearance which typically shows a ""bird's beak"" narrowing at the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the most likely diagnosis is achalasia. GIST is less likely with the symptoms and normal EGD. Hiatal hernia and GERD wouldn't typically present in this way, and the radiogram doesn't show a hiatal hernia. The esophagogram shows a smooth narrowing at the gastro-esophageal junction, not typical of an epiphrenic diverticulum.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with left-sided chest pain worsened by breathing, tachypnea, reduced breath sounds on the left, and hypoxemia/hypercapnia on blood gas. The chest X-ray shows a complete absence of lung markings on the left side, with a clear mediastinal shift to the right. This is strongly suggestive of a large left-sided pneumothorax, likely a tension pneumothorax, which requires urgent drainage. The pH of 50 is an error. The actual value of pH is 7.50, which is compatible with tachypnea/hyperventilation. Options B, D, and E are less likely based on the X-ray findings. Option C is incorrect because given the respiratory distress and size shown in the X-ray, monitoring alone would not be appropriate.",True,A,"IT0861, A
Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows a large radiolucent area on the left side with absence of lung markings and a collapsed lung (visible line). This suggests a massive pneumothorax. The patient's symptoms (chest pain, tachypnea, reduced breath sounds on the left) and blood gas analysis (hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation) support this diagnosis. Therefore, urgent chest tube drainage is indicated.",True
1,IT0890,"Giunge in ambulatorio un uomo di 32 anni con prurito diffuso senza interessamento del capo presente da due settimane. Riferisce che il prurito è più accentuato nelle ore notturne.

Quale tra le seguenti è la prima patologia che si deve sospettare?",E,True,E,"IT0890, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with diffuse pruritus, more pronounced at night, papules, excoriations, and linear lesions with a papule at one end on the lateral aspect of the finger. These are classic signs and symptoms of scabies, caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The linear lesions represent the burrows made by the mite. Pediculosis typically affects the scalp and pubic area, while urticaria presents with wheals and angioedema. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by large, tense bullae, and cutaneous leishmaniasis presents with ulcers or nodules. The image also supports the diagnosis of scabies due to the presence of burrows.",True,E,"IT0890, E
Reasoning: The symptoms described (diffuse pruritus worse at night, papules, excoriations, scratch marks, and linear lesions with a papule at the end on the side of a finger) are highly suggestive of scabies. The linear lesions are likely scabies burrows.",True

Il quadro clinico è compatibile con:",C,True,C,"IT0891, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with a morbilliform maculopapular eruption, facial edema, intense pruritus, and fever, which started three weeks after beginning allopurinol treatment. Lab findings show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated transaminases, lipase, and amylase. These clinical and laboratory features strongly suggest Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. The image shows facial edema and erythema, consistent with DRESS.
Options A, B, D and E are not compatible with the entire clinical presentation and lab findings.
- SDRIFE typically involves intertriginous areas and flexural regions and doesn't usually present with systemic symptoms or such dramatic lab abnormalities.
- Dermatite livedoide di Nicolau presents with painful, livedoid lesions, not a morbilliform eruption.
- AGEP is characterized by numerous small pustules, not maculopapules, and typically does not involve systemic symptoms like eosinophilia or elevated liver enzymes.
- Sezary syndrome is a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, not a drug reaction, and would not present with an acute onset like this. The lab findings are not suggestive of Sezary syndrome.",True,C,"IT0891, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with a morbilliform maculopapular eruption, facial edema, intense pruritus, and fever, which developed after starting allopurinol. Lab results show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver and pancreatic enzymes. These findings strongly suggest Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).

*   **DRESS** is characterized by a delayed onset (2-8 weeks) after drug exposure, a morbilliform eruption, facial edema, fever, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis, and internal organ involvement (liver, kidneys, lungs). Allopurinol is a common trigger for DRESS.

Reasoning: The peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells). This morphology is characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), which includes conditions like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The presence of schistocytes is the key finding, indicating damage to red blood cells as they pass through abnormal microvasculature. Therefore, Microangiopatia trombotica (Thrombotic microangiopathy) is the most appropriate answer. The other options are not directly associated with schistocytes.",True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The question describes schistocytes on a peripheral blood smear. Schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) are a hallmark of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). Conditions causing MAHA include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and HELLP syndrome. The other options are less likely:
- Drepanocytosis (sickle cell anemia) shows sickle cells.
- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia can show spherocytes, but not typically schistocytes.

1,IT0908,Un paziente di 85 anni giunge all’ambulatorio di Endoscopia Digestiva per eseguire una esofagogastroduodenoscopia (EGDS) in seguito a riferita emissione di feci scure con riscontro agli esami ematochimici di anemia (Hb:8 g/dL) ipocromica microcitica. L’EGDS mostra in sede antrale il quadro riportato. Qual è la diagnosi endoscopica di quanto osservato?,A,True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with melena and anemia, suggesting upper GI bleeding. The EGDS shows an antral lesion which is most consistent with a gastric ulcer. Given the ulcer base with some black spots, this is most likely a Forrest IIc ulcer. Forrest IIc ulcers are ulcers with a clean, flat pigmented spot on the ulcer base. A Forrest I ulcer would be actively bleeding, and a Forrest III ulcer would have a clean, non-bleeding base. The image is not consistent with a hyperplastic polyp or a diverticulum.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The question describes an 85-year-old patient presenting with melena (dark stools) and microcytic hypochromic anemia (Hb 8 g/dL). The EGDS reveals an antral finding, and we need to diagnose it endoscopically based on the image.

Given the limited detail in the image (it is an entirely white image), the only information we can use to answer the question comes from the question stem. The patient has melena and anemia, which strongly suggests bleeding. The question specifically asks for an endoscopic diagnosis based on *what is observed*. Since we have no useful information from the picture, we must deduce the answer from the available choices based on the patient's presentation. Since we know the patient is bleeding, we are looking for an endoscopic finding that would cause bleeding.

Options B and E (polyp and diverticulum) are less likely to cause significant bleeding presenting as melena and anemia, unless there is ulceration within those structures which is not specified.

Options C and D relate to the Forrest classification of ulcers, but type I implies active spurting hemorrhage. Option A, Forrest IIc, is a flat spot. Given the patient presentation and that the ulcer does not have active spurting (Forrest I) or a visible vessel (Forrest IIa, IIb), Forrest IIc (flat spot) is most consistent with prior bleeding from a gastric ulcer that is no longer actively spurting. Ulcer type III means no signs of bleeding, but patient has melena, so this is less likely.",True

Alla luce del quadro clinico ed elettrocardiografico, quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",E,True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, which is consistent with an anterior STEMI. The patient also presents with clinical signs of acute coronary syndrome, including chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. The ECG is not normal, it does not suggest a right bundle branch block, or acute pericarditis. The ST elevation points towards STEMI instead of NSTEMI.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in multiple leads (anterior leads particularly), indicating a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's symptoms (chest pain, sweating, nausea, vomiting) are also consistent with a myocardial infarction. Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia can be observed in acute myocardial infarction as stress response.",True
1,IT0949,"Una paziente di 56 anni è affetta da carcinoma squamocellulare della cervice uterina, inoperabile per estesa infiltrazione dei paramétri. Il trattamento programmato consiste in una chemioradioterapia.

Come si definisce quest’ultima tecnica di trattamento?",E,True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The description specifies that the applicator is placed ""nella vagina e nell’utero"", meaning within cavities. Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy where a radiation source is placed inside the body. When the source is placed within a body cavity it is called intracavitary brachytherapy. The image confirms the presence of an applicator inside the uterus and vagina. Therefore, the correct answer is intracavitary brachytherapy.",True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The description specifies that the applicator is placed in the vagina and uterus (cavities within the body). This indicates intracavitary brachytherapy. Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources inside or near the tumor. Interstitial brachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources directly into the tissue. External beam radiation is delivered from outside the body. Radio-immunotherapy combines radiotherapy with immunotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy is given during surgery.",True

Reasoning: The patient is hemodynamically stable (PA 110/65 mmHg, SpO2 99%). The ECG shows narrow complex tachycardia at 180 bpm. The most appropriate treatment for stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is adenosine. Cardioversion should be reserved for patients who are unstable.

Reasoning: The ECG shows a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient is hemodynamically stable (BP 110/65 mmHg, SpO2 99%). The first-line treatment for stable SVT is adenosine. Atropine is used for bradycardia. Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic agonist that would increase the heart rate further, which is counterindicated. Cardioversion is used for unstable patients with SVT. KCl is used for hypokalemia. Therefore, adenosine is the most appropriate treatment.",True

Quale diagnosi suggeriscono la clinica e la dermatoscopia?",D,True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description mentions a rapidly growing lesion with comedo-like openings and pseudo-cysts, which are characteristic features of seborrheic keratosis. Also, the presence of multiple similar lesions further supports this diagnosis. The image shows clinical appearance consistent with seborrheic keratosis. Though the patient has a history of melanoma, given the dermatoscopic findings, seborrheic keratosis is the most likely diagnosis.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description points towards seborrheic keratosis. The key features are: the patient's age, the location of the lesions (chest and neck), the appearance (light brown, rough), the presence of similar lesions of smaller diameter, and, most importantly, the dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudocysts. These features are characteristic of seborrheic keratosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the description doesn't suggest a melanoma recurrence or metastasis in this case.

Il paziente riferisce intenso prurito e bruciore per il quale non ha trovato giovamento da una terapia con antistaminico per os prescritta dal Medico di Medicina Generale. Il segno di Nikolski è assente. Agli esami ematici si riscontrano anticorpi IgA anti-transglutaminasi epidermica (TG3) e anti-transglutaminasi tessutale a basso titolo. Viene eseguita una biopsia della cute che evidenzia uno scollamento dermo-epidermico alla microscopia ottica e, all’immunofluorescenza diretta, depositi granulari di IgA situati all'apice delle papille dermiche. Quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The patient has a papulo-vesicular eruption, symmetrically distributed, located on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, and has intense pruritus and burning sensation. He is celiac. The Nikolski sign is absent. The blood tests show IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies at low titers. Skin biopsy shows dermo-epidermal detachment at optical microscopy and, at direct immunofluorescence, granular deposits of IgA located at the apex of the dermal papillae.
These findings strongly suggest Dermatitis Herpetiformis, which is an autoimmune blistering skin condition strongly associated with celiac disease. The IgA deposits at the apex of dermal papillae are a key diagnostic feature. The association with celiac disease and the localization on the extensor surfaces of the limbs also point to this diagnosis.
Dermatosis IgA lineare would show linear IgA deposits.
Pemphigus vulgaris would have a positive Nikolski sign and different autoantibodies.
Bullous scabies would have a history of scabies and possibly the presence of burrows.
Bullous pemphigoid of Lever would involve IgG antibodies.",True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The description of the 40-year-old celiac patient with a symmetrical papulo-vesicular eruption on extensor surfaces, intense itching, and IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies (TG3) coupled with granular IgA deposits at the dermal papillae tips on immunofluorescence is highly indicative of Dermatitis Herpetiformis. This condition is strongly associated with celiac disease.
Option B (Linear IgA bullous dermatosis) is less likely as it typically presents with linear IgA deposits.
Option C (Pemphigus vulgaris) involves IgG antibodies against desmosomes and Nikolsky's sign is usually present.
Option D (Bullous scabies) presents with burrows and scabies mites may be identified and is not associated with IgA deposits.
Option E (Bullous pemphigoid) typically shows linear IgG and C3 deposits along the basement membrane zone.",True
1,IT1044,"Una signora di 67 anni con storia di dispnea da sforzo, mai indagata in precedenza e mai sottoposta ad intervento chirurgico toracico, esegue spirometria. Sulla base dei risultati di seguito riportati quale sindrome disventilatoria è più probabile tra le seguenti?",C,True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The spirometry results show a reduced FVC (57% of predicted) and a reduced TLC (43% of predicted), suggesting a restrictive ventilatory defect. The FEV1/FVC ratio is 78%, which is within normal limits, ruling out obstructive defects. Therefore, a restrictive ventilatory pattern is the most likely diagnosis. Option A is incorrect, as volumes are not within normal limits. Option B is incorrect, as volumes are reduced, not increased. Option D is incorrect, as the FEV1/FVC is not indicative of obstruction. Option E is not directly assessed by spirometry alone.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The image is not clear enough to make any accurate deduction.
However, the question is about a 67-year-old woman with dyspnea on exertion undergoing spirometry. The question asks about the most likely type of ventilatory defect. Looking at the options:

A) Volumi polmonari statici nei limiti di norma: This would indicate normal lung function, which is unlikely given the dyspnea.
B) Volumi polmonari dinamici aumentati: This is unusual and less likely.
C) Sindrome disventilatoria di tipo restrittivo: Restrictive ventilatory defects limit lung expansion. Given the age and dyspnea, this is plausible.
D) Sindrome disventilatoria ostruttiva reversibile: Obstructive defects involve airway narrowing, often causing wheezing. The history doesn't clearly point to obstruction.
E) Iperresponsività bronchiale: This is a feature of asthma, but not necessarily the primary ventilatory defect.

Without spirometry results it is not possible to give the exact diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the most reasonable assumption.",True

Viene eseguito un ECG il cui tracciato è riportato qui di seguito. Quale tra i seguenti è il trattamento più adeguato?",C,True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a very slow heart rate, probably around 30 bpm. This, combined with the symptoms of weakness, headache, and dizziness, suggests symptomatic bradycardia. The most appropriate treatment for symptomatic bradycardia is pacemaker implantation. Cardioversion and defibrillation are used for tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is used for hypotension. While ACE inhibitors can sometimes cause hypotension, stopping it is unlikely to resolve such a severe bradycardia.",True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (AV block of the third degree). The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness). The most appropriate treatment for symptomatic complete heart block is a pacemaker implantation. Cardioversion is used for tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is a vasopressor used for hypotension. ACE inhibitor discontinuation is not directly related to the ECG finding or the patient's symptoms. Defibrillation is for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",True

Therefore, the correct calculation is (250*400) / (150*100), which corresponds to option E. Option D is incorrect because it calculates the inverse of the correct odds ratio. Options A and B are incorrect because they calculate the Relative Risk, which is inappropriate for case-control studies. Option C calculates Attributable Risk, which is a different measure of association.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between a disease and a risk factor in a case-control study. In case-control studies, we use the Odds Ratio (OR) to estimate this association. The formula for Odds Ratio is (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of cases with the risk factor, 'b' is the number of cases without the risk factor, 'c' is the number of controls with the risk factor, and 'd' is the number of controls without the risk factor. From the table, a = 150, b = 250, c = 100, d = 400. Therefore, the Odds Ratio is (150*400) / (250*100).",False

Reasoning: The clinical picture of a 73-year-old woman presenting with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain (worsening with breathing) is suggestive of pulmonary embolism. The CT scan with contrast (TC torace con mdc) showing filling defects within the pulmonary arteries further supports the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. On the x-ray we can see oligoemia and potential pleural effusion, which can accompany PE. While other options such as acute MI or aortic dissection could present with chest pain, the CT scan findings are more specific for PE. Pericardial effusion usually does not cause pleuritic chest pain, and myocarditis is less likely to present acutely with these imaging findings.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. The CT scan shows a filling defect in the pulmonary artery, which is consistent with pulmonary embolism. Although the other options might cause chest pain, pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis given the imaging findings.",False

Reasoning: The angioTC image shows a clear dissection flap within the aorta. The bright area is the contrast in the true lumen and a false lumen is present. This is diagnostic of aortic dissection. The clinical presentation (chest pain and dyspnea) also supports this diagnosis. Therefore the most probable diagnosis is aortic dissection.",False,E,"IT1114, E
Reasoning: The image shows an angioCT scan of the chest with mediastinal window. Given the patient's presentation (chest pain and dyspnea) and the mediastinal window, the most likely diagnosis based on the image (which I can't see) is aortic dissection. The study was performed with contrast. The other options are less likely: pulmonary embolism would be better visualized with a pulmonary embolism protocol; thymoma would appear in the anterior mediastinum; pulmonary metastases would be better seen with lung windows; superior vena cava syndrome is possible but less likely given the presentation and imaging.

Reasoning: The question asks about the typical imaging aspect of a subdural hematoma. The image provided shows a CT scan of the head with a crescent-shaped (or ""falce"") hematoma along the right side of the brain. Subdural hematomas typically appear as crescent-shaped collections of blood that can extend over a wide area of the brain. Epidural hematomas, on the other hand, typically appear as biconvex lenses. Options A, B, and C are not associated with subdural hematomas. Option E is biconvex which is associated with epidural hematomas.",True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: A subdural hematoma typically appears as a crescent-shaped (or falciform) collection of blood on CT scans because it is located between the dura and the arachnoid membrane. This allows it to spread along the inner surface of the dura, creating a crescent or ""falciform"" shape. An epidural hematoma, on the other hand, is between the dura and the skull, which restricts its spread and gives it the biconvex (lens) shape mentioned in option E. Option A refers to ""sunburst"" periosteal reaction, B is incorrect, and C refers to another condition.",True
