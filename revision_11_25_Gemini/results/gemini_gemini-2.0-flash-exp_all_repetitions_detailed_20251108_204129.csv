1,IT0031,"[Paziente uomo di 85 anni, pregresso ictus ischemico, diabetico, in terapia polifarmacologica.

Reasoning: The patient is an elderly (85 years old) man with a history of ischemic stroke and diabetes, and is on polypharmacy. He presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled bullae, accompanied by intense pruritus. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, especially given the age and the description of tense bullae on an erythematous base. Pemphigus vulgaris usually presents with flaccid bullae that rupture easily, which doesn't fit the description of ""tense"" bullae. Herpes zoster typically presents with painful, unilateral, dermatomal distribution of vesicles. Contact dermatitis usually presents with localized lesions and history of exposure. Bullous impetigo is more common in children and presents with superficial bullae. The presence of tense bullae and the patient's age makes bullous pemphigoid the most likely diagnosis.

Reasoning: The patient is elderly, has a history of ischemic stroke and diabetes, and is on polypharmacy. He presents with widespread urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled bullae with intense itching. These clinical features are highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease common in the elderly.
The other options are less likely:
- Pemphigus vulgaris: blisters are usually flaccid and easily rupture, involving mucosal surfaces more frequently.
- Herpes Zoster: typically presents as a unilateral, dermatomal rash with pain rather than itching.
- Contact dermatitis: would likely have a more localized distribution and a history of exposure to an irritant or allergen.
- Bullous impetigo: typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus and presents with superficial bullae, more common in children.",True

Le lesioni sono intensamente pruriginose.] Qual è il procedimento diagnostico più appropriato?",B,True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense bullae filled with clear fluid, suggesting a bullous dermatosis. Given the patient's age and medical history, bullous pemphigoid is a strong consideration. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to identify the specific antibody deposition pattern at the basement membrane zone, along with serum testing for anti-basement membrane antibodies. Option A is related to celiac disease, not bullous skin conditions. Option C is not helpful. Option D (Tzank smear) is useful for detecting herpes infections (Tzanck cells), but it's not relevant for bullous diseases. Option E is related to pemphigus vulgaris. Bullous pemphigoid involves antibodies against the basement membrane, so B is the best option. The image also shows the tense bullae characteristic of bullous pemphigoid.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques and tense blisters containing clear fluid, which are intensely pruritic. This clinical presentation suggests a bullous dermatosis. Bullous pemphigoid is a possibility, especially considering the patient's age and medical history. To confirm the diagnosis and differentiate between various bullous dermatoses, a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is necessary. The biopsy will help visualize the location of blister formation (subepidermal in bullous pemphigoid) and the DIF will detect antibody deposition (IgG and/or C3) at the basement membrane zone. Therefore, searching for anti-basement membrane antibodies is essential in the diagnostic workup.

Option A (anti-gliadin and anti-transglutaminase) is relevant for celiac disease, which is not the primary concern based on the skin lesions.
Option C (dermatoscopy) can be helpful in some skin conditions, but it's not the most appropriate initial step for diagnosing bullous diseases.
Option D (Tzank smear) is useful for diagnosing herpes infections and other viral conditions but less relevant for bullous diseases that are not primarily infectious.
Option E (anti-desmoglein 1 and anti-desmoglein 3) is relevant for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, which are also bullous diseases, but the clinical presentation described (urticarial plaques preceding tense blisters) is more suggestive of bullous pemphigoid than pemphigus. While pemphigus cannot be ruled out at this stage, the initial diagnostic approach should include testing for anti-basement membrane antibodies since bullous pemphigoid is more likely.",True
1,IT0053,"[In uno studio caso-controllo per comprendere l'eziologia del cancro dell'esofago, 870 casi e 902 controlli sono stati indagati per quanto concerne il consumo abituale di superalcolici.] L'associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio può essere quantificata calcolando:",C,True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association is the odds ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where a is the number of exposed cases, b is the number of exposed controls, c is the number of unexposed cases, and d is the number of unexposed controls. From the table, a = 656, b = 516, c = 214, and d = 386. Therefore, OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). Option C correctly reflects this calculation.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: Since this is a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association is the odds ratio (OR). The odds ratio is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where a is the number of cases exposed to the risk factor, b is the number of cases not exposed, c is the number of controls exposed, and d is the number of controls not exposed.

Based on the question and options:
- Cases = 870, Controls = 902
- Let's assume 656 cases were exposed to the risk factor (consumption of spirits). Then 870 - 656 = 214 cases were not exposed.
- Let's assume 214 controls were exposed to the risk factor. Then 902 - 214 = 688 controls were not exposed. The options seem to be written assuming that the numbers in the options represent these values, even though they are not explicitly given in the problem. There appears to be an error in the options. Let's solve for the option that is the closest match to the calculation of the Odds Ratio.

Based on the information given and the structure of the options:
a = 656
c = 214
b is assumed to be based on the number of cases not exposed: 870 - 656 = 214, and the number of controls not exposed to the risk factor is 902-214 = 688. It appears an error occured when constructing the options. 
Option C calculates the OR using these values, but with the assumption that 386 represents d, which is inconsistent with the number of controls we can derive. The question states that 870 + 902 cases and controls, respectively, were investigated. The options mention 656 and 214. 656 + 214 = 870. Therefore, we can conclude that 656 were the cases who did consume spirits, and 214 were the cases that did not consume spirits. Next, the problem asks how to quantify the relationship. The correct relationship is Odds Ratio (OR). OR = (a/b)/(c/d) where a,b,c,d are as stated before. We can rewrite this as OR = (a*d)/(b*c).

Now we need to find ""d"". We know that 902 controls were investigated, and that 214 did drink spirits. Therefore, d = 902-214 = 688.
OR = (656*688)/(214*214)
The answer must follow the formula OR = (656*d)/(214*c), which only option C matches. Therefore the answer is Option C.

Final Answer:
IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the association between a disease and a risk factor is quantified using the Odds Ratio (OR). The formula for OR is (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of cases exposed, 'b' is the number of cases unexposed, 'c' is the number of controls exposed, and 'd' is the number of controls unexposed. Based on the way that the options are presented, it appears option C: OR: (656 · 386) / (516 · 214), represents the correct way of calculating the OR even though there is potentially missing information, or incorrect numbers. The closest option matching the OR formula is C.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and quicker to conduct than cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. This is because they start with individuals who already have the disease (cases) and compare them to a group of individuals without the disease (controls). This retrospective approach saves time and resources. Case-control studies cannot directly calculate incidence or prevalence because the study population is defined by disease status, not by a defined population at risk. The image provides data for the case-control study. It confirms there are ""Malati"" (cases) and ""Non malati"" (controls), and information about exposure. This type of study design is well-suited to address the research question. Therefore, the low cost and short duration are major advantages. The options related to calculating incidence or prevalence are incorrect.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and can be completed in a shorter time frame compared to other study designs like cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. Options B, C, D, and E all mention calculating incidence or prevalence, which are not directly calculated in case-control studies. Instead, case-control studies are used to estimate odds ratios.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL indicating an extensive anterior STEMI. The patient is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardic (57/min). While awaiting transfer to the catheterization lab, the patient should receive antiplatelet therapy. Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor that reduces platelet aggregation. Nitroprussiate is contraindicated in hypotension. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker and would further reduce heart rate and blood pressure. Warfarin is an anticoagulant and not indicated in the acute setting. Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is also contraindicated in acute hypotension.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient is a 48-year-old smoker with hypertension on ACE inhibitors, presenting with epigastric pain for 6 hours. The vitals show hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardia (57/min). The ECG is not provided, but given the need to alert the hemodynamics room, it suggests a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or myocardial infarction.
A) Nitroprussiate of sodium is a potent vasodilator and is contraindicated in hypotension.
B) Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker and can further lower blood pressure and heart rate, thus is not a good option.
C) Warfarin is an anticoagulant and is not appropriate in the acute management of suspected ACS.
D) Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor, an antiplatelet medication used in ACS. Given the suspicion of ACS, this would be appropriate to administer while awaiting intervention.
E) Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor already used for hypertension; it would be contraindicated in the presence of hypotension.

Therefore, Ticagrelor is the most appropriate initial treatment.",True

Reasoning: The clinical picture describes a young man involved in a high-impact trauma (motorcycle vs. car accident) with neurological signs including unresponsiveness (eyes closed, no opening to verbal or painful stimuli, absent speech), withdrawal to pain, and anisocoria (right > left). These findings are highly suggestive of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) with possible increased intracranial pressure. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdensity along the inner surface of the skull, conforming to the brain. This appearance is classic for an acute subdural hematoma. Epidural hematomas typically have a lens or biconvex shape, intraparenchymal hematomas appear within the brain parenchyma, chronic subdural hematomas may be isodense or hypodense, and subgaleal hematomas are located outside the skull. Therefore, the most likely finding is an acute subdural hematoma.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's presentation (unresponsive, anisocoria, withdrawal to pain) after a high-impact trauma like a motorcycle accident points towards significant intracranial injury. While all the hematoma types listed could potentially occur, the most likely acute finding given the symptoms and trauma mechanism is an intraparenchymal hematoma. This would directly damage brain tissue, causing the patient's decreased level of consciousness and neurological deficits. Anisocoria (unequal pupils) is a concerning sign, often related to increased intracranial pressure from a mass lesion. While epidural and subdural hematomas are possibilities, intraparenchymal hematomas are common in traumatic brain injury and can cause significant midline shift and herniation due to their location within the brain tissue itself. Subgaleal hematomas are external to the skull and typically don't cause these symptoms. Chronic subdural hematomas are less likely given the acute nature of the injury. Therefore, intraparenchymal hematoma is the most probable finding on CT.",False

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is anterior glenohumeral dislocation.",True,B,"IT0111, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with shoulder pain after a fall on an outstretched hand with the shoulder slightly abducted and extended. This mechanism of injury is highly suggestive of anterior shoulder dislocation (anterior glenohumeral dislocation). A radiograph would confirm this diagnosis by showing the humeral head displaced anteriorly and inferiorly relative to the glenoid fossa. The other options are less likely given the described mechanism. A fracture of the greater tuberosity (trochite) could occur with a dislocation, but the dislocation itself is the more primary diagnosis. Acromioclavicular joint dislocations involve separation of the acromion and clavicle. Glenoid fractures are less common with this type of fall, and posterior shoulder dislocations are far less frequent and have different mechanisms.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a patient with lower back pain and an MRI finding suggestive of bone metastasis. The most appropriate next step to identify bone metastases is a bone scan (scintigrafia ossea). Bone scans are highly sensitive for detecting areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic disease.
TC del rachide in toto is less sensitive, and TC dello scheletro in toto con mezzo di contrasto, while possibly more accurate than CT without contrast, is still not the gold standard.
Esame ecografico selettivo delle regioni scheletriche sospette is highly specific to the areas being checked and is dependent on knowing where the issues would be.

Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate investigation to identify the presence of bone metastases after an MRI suggests a possible bone metastasis in a 45-year-old patient with lower back pain. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is a highly sensitive imaging technique for detecting bone metastases because it identifies areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic lesions.

Reasoning: The clinical presentation (sudden onset headache, vomiting, aphasia, right hemiparesis) and the CT scan showing a hyperdense area in the left fronto-parietal region strongly suggest an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient's history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis makes spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage a more probable diagnosis. The hyperdensity seen on the CT scan is consistent with acute blood.
A) Epidural hematoma is less likely given the clinical presentation and CT findings. Epidural hematomas are usually associated with trauma and often have a lens-shaped appearance.
B) The CT scan shows a dense lesion within the brain parenchyma, not subdural. Also, the symptoms indicate a lesion in the left hemisphere, not right.
D) Ischemic stroke is a possibility but less likely given the sudden onset headache and vomiting, which are more common with hemorrhagic stroke. Also, the CT scan appears hyperdense, not hypodense as expected in early ischemic stroke.
E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage could cause sudden onset headache and vomiting. However, the CT scan shows a localized intraparenchymal hemorrhage rather than diffuse blood in the subarachnoid space.",True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache and vomiting followed by aphasia and right hemiparesis. The history includes hypertension and liver cirrhosis. The CT scan (although hard to see) shows a hyperdense area in the left frontoparietal region, which is consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The left hemisphere involvement explains the right hemiparesis and aphasia. Given the hypertension and sudden onset, a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage is the most likely diagnosis. An epidural hematoma would be less likely to cause the aphasia and hemiparesis as quickly. A subdural hematoma could cause these symptoms, but is less likely given the sudden onset and the patient's medical history. Ischemic stroke could cause these symptoms but would not typically present with sudden onset headache and vomiting initially, and a hemorrhage is more likely given the history of hypertension and the appearance on CT. Subarachnoid hemorrhage would typically present with a more diffuse headache and meningismus, and is less likely given the hemiparesis. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is intraparenchymal hemorrhage.",True
1,IT0236,"[Una donna di 76 anni riferisce di sentire, da alcuni mesi, il braccio di destra più debole; tale disturbo sembra avere un andamento peggiorativo. Nelle ultime settimane sarebbero inoltre comparse delle difficoltà nell'eloquio. La paziente si reca quindi dal neurologo che riscontra un deficit stenico all'arto superiore di destra e una afasia espressiva. Consiglia quindi l'esecuzione di una RM encefalo con mezzo di contrasto. Tale esame evidenzia la presenza di una lesione espansiva verosimilmente extra-assiale a livello frontale destro, captante vivacemente e omogeneamente contrasto, associata a ispessimento della dura madre perilesionale (tail durale) (si veda immagine).] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The clinical presentation (progressive weakness in the right arm, expressive aphasia) suggests a lesion in the left frontal lobe (due to the language disturbance and contralateral motor deficit). The MRI findings (extra-axial lesion, contrast enhancement, dural tail) are highly suggestive of a meningioma. Based on the image, the lesion is on the right frontal region so we chose option A because there is no right side selection for the right diagnosis of meningioma. Gliomas are usually intra-axial. Metastases are possible, but meningiomas are much more common. Subdural hematomas are usually associated with trauma. Intraparenchymal hemorrhages are not typically associated with dural tails.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description suggests a slow-growing lesion in the right frontal area, causing weakness in the right arm and expressive aphasia. The MRI shows an extra-axial lesion with contrast enhancement and dural tail, characteristic of a meningioma. The right-sided symptoms and frontal location point towards a meningioma affecting the frontal area. Considering the clinical presentation (weakness on the RIGHT, aphasia implying LEFT hemisphere involvement) and the MRI findings of an extra-axial lesion, A is incorrect as the question states the lesion is on the right, leading to right arm weakness (implying the lesion is affecting the left hemisphere) and aphasia. An expanding lesion on the left frontal lobe will impact on the motor control of the right side of the body and the language centre. Therefore, the meningioma has to be located on the LEFT.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly at night, that is relieved by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). This is a classic presentation of osteoid osteoma. The imaging shows a small, round, radiolucent nidus surrounded by dense sclerosis in the femur, which is also characteristic of osteoid osteoma. Condroblastoma and enchondroma usually occur at the epiphysis. Osteosarcoma tends to occur in younger age groups, presents with a more aggressive pattern and is not relieved by aspirin. Similarly, chondrosarcoma tends to occur in older age groups.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The description of a 19-year-old male with intense night pain in the thigh that is relieved by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is highly characteristic of osteoid osteoma. While the image isn't particularly helpful for diagnosis without more context, the clinical picture is the strongest indicator. Osteoid osteoma produces prostaglandins, which cause the pain. Aspirin inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, thus relieving the pain. The other options are less likely given this specific presentation.",True

Reasoning: The lesions described and shown in the image are most likely condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgical excision are all reasonable treatment options for condylomata acuminata. Topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used to treat genital warts. Salicylic acid is a keratolytic agent, and while it can help remove the surface of the warts, it does not address the underlying viral infection. Corticosteroids can suppress the immune system, which could potentially worsen the infection. Therefore, the least indicated therapy is topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids.",True,E,"IT0311, E
Reasoning: The question describes perineal papules that are pink-brown, sometimes merging into plaques, and asymptomatic. This is characteristic of condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, surgical removal, and imiquimod are all established treatments for condylomata. Salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used for condylomata. Therefore, topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are NOT indicated.",True

Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows a large area of hyperlucency (increased blackness) in the left hemithorax, with absence of lung markings. This is consistent with a pneumothorax (air in the pleural space). The trachea is also deviated to the right, suggesting a tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition.

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense collection overlying the cerebral hemisphere, causing mass effect and midline shift. This is characteristic of an acute subdural hematoma. The patient's history of a motorcycle accident and a GCS of 8/15 further support this diagnosis. An epidural hematoma typically has a lenticular (convex) shape. Intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal hematoma would have different appearances on the CT scan.",True,B,"IT0375, B

Reasoning: A displaced fracture of the mid-shaft of the humerus is commonly associated with radial nerve damage due to its proximity to the spiral groove of the humerus. The other options are less likely. Median nerve lesion is more common with supracondylar fractures of humerus. Brachial artery injury is less common than radial nerve injury in humeral shaft fractures. Ulnar nerve lesion is more commonly seen with medial epicondyle fractures. Pulmonary thromboembolism is a late complication.",True,C,"IT0390, C
Reasoning: The question describes a displaced fracture of the mid-shaft humerus. The most common immediate complication of this type of fracture is injury to the radial nerve, as it courses in the radial groove along the posterior aspect of the humerus in this region. The other options are less likely. Median and ulnar nerve injuries are more associated with fractures around the elbow. Brachial artery injury is possible, but less frequent than radial nerve injury.

Reasoning: The ECG shows sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern, which is characteristic of pulmonary embolism. The patient's history (70 years old, hypertensive, smoker, recent prostatectomy) and symptoms (sudden dyspnea, hypotension, hypoxemia) further support the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.
The ECG features supporting PE are: S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III and inverted T wave in lead III.
Sindrome di Brugada would have specific ST elevation in V1-V3.
Aortic dissection may have nonspecific ECG changes or even signs of ischemia.

Reasoning: The patient presents with acute dyspnea, hypotension (100/50 mmHg), and hypoxemia (SpO2 88%) in the setting of recent prostatectomy, hypertension, and smoking. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern. All these findings are suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition predisposing to sudden cardiac death but is not associated with dyspnea. Aortic dissection typically presents with severe chest pain. Postoperative anemia can cause dyspnea, but the acute onset and low blood pressure are not typical features. Heart failure is less likely to cause such acute onset of symptoms. The ECG findings of S1Q3T3 are the most significant indicator for pulmonary embolism, along with the patient's presentation and risk factors.",True

Reasoning: The clinical history points towards a chronic subdural hematoma: an elderly patient with a history of trauma (fall), anticoagulant use (warfarin), progressive neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech problems, right-sided weakness). The CT scan description of a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso- to hypodense compared to the brain parenchyma further supports the diagnosis of a chronic subdural hematoma. Acute subdural hematomas are typically hyperdense on CT. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage would be within the brain tissue, not a crescent shape on the surface. Subarachnoid hemorrhage wouldn't typically appear as a focal collection like this. Epidural hematomas typically have a lenticular (lens) shape.",True,A,"IT0512, A
Reasoning: The patient has a history of a head trauma 4 weeks ago, difficulty walking, speech problems and right side weakness. He is also on warfarin. The CT scan reveals a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense compared to the brain parenchyma. These findings are highly suggestive of a chronic subdural hematoma.

Reasoning: The X-ray shows a fracture through the proximal humeral physis (growth plate), which is known as a Salter-Harris type I fracture or epiphyseal separation. This type of fracture is common in children after trauma because the growth plate is weaker than the surrounding bone. The age of the patient (10 years old) also fits this diagnosis.
The other options are less likely:
A) Cisti ossea giovanile (Juvenile bone cyst) - This would typically present as a lucent lesion within the bone, not an obvious fracture.
B) Frattura della clavicola (Clavicle fracture) - The fracture is clearly not in the clavicle.
C) Sarcoma di Ewing (Ewing's sarcoma) - This would usually have a more aggressive appearance with periosteal reaction and soft tissue mass.
E) Condrosarcoma (Chondrosarcoma) - This is a malignant cartilage tumor more common in adults, not in children. The appearance on the x-ray does not suggest a chondrosarcoma.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a proximal humeral epiphyseal separation.",False,D,"IT0784, D
Reasoning: The X-ray shows a widening of the proximal humeral physis with displacement, consistent with a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the proximal humerus. This type of injury is common in children after trauma and affects the epiphyseal plate. Options A, C, and E are less likely given the acute traumatic onset and radiographic appearance. Option B (clavicle fracture) is less likely since the area indicated by the question is near the shoulder joint and not the clavicle.

The arthroscopic image (A) shows a displaced meniscal fragment and the MRI (B) shows a meniscal tear. These are classic findings for a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus. Osteochondral lesions, ligament injuries and tibial plateau fractures would typically present differently on imaging and physical exam. Posterior cruciate ligament injuries are less common. Therefore, E is the most likely diagnosis.",True,E,"IT0785, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with acute knee pain, swelling, a locking sensation, and limited range of motion (20-90 degrees) following a twisting injury. These symptoms are highly suggestive of a meniscal tear. The ""bucket-handle tear"" is a specific type of meniscal tear that often causes locking of the knee. The arthroscopic image (Figure A) and MRI (Figure B) would likely show the displaced meniscal fragment in a bucket-handle configuration. Other options are less likely: Osteochondral lesions and tibial plateau fractures are less associated with a locking sensation. ACL tears are also possible with this type of injury, however, the locking reported supports the bucket handle meniscal tear.

Reasoning: The image shows the ""bird's beak"" appearance, which is a characteristic sign of achalasia. The patient's symptoms of post-prandial and nocturnal regurgitation, increasing dysphagia, and occasional chest pain further support this diagnosis. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy was negative for neoplastic lesions, making GIST less likely. Although the patient experiences chest pain, a cardiac evaluation was negative. A hiatal hernia is a possibility, but the classic image speaks more strongly for achalasia. An epiphrenic diverticulum would present as a sac-like protrusion, which is not visible in the image.

This is caused by the failure of the LES to relax, leading to food and liquid build-up in the esophagus. GIST is a possibility, but less likely given the symptoms and radiographic appearance. Hiatal hernia could cause similar symptoms, but the esophagography is more suggestive of achalasia. While GERD is a possibility, it is less likely given that there is progressive dysphagia. Lastly, an epiphrenic diverticulum could explain dysphagia, however, it is not characterized by the image.",True

Reasoning: The clinical presentation includes left-sided chest pain intensified by breathing, tachypnea, and reduced breath sounds on the left side. The blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia (PaO2 62 mmHg) and hypocapnia (PaCO2 28 mmHg). The chest X-ray shows a large hyperlucency on the left side with absence of lung markings, and the lung is collapsed.

Reasoning: The presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on a peripheral blood smear is indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is a condition characterized by the destruction of red blood cells in the small blood vessels.

Reasoning: The description states that an applicator loaded with iridium 192 sources is placed inside the vagina and uterus. This means the radiation source is placed within a body cavity (vagina and uterus). This corresponds to intracavitary brachytherapy.

Reasoning: The question describes a brachytherapy technique where an applicator loaded with Iridium-192 is placed in the vagina and uterus. This is the definition of intracavitary brachytherapy, as the radiation source is placed within a body cavity (the vagina and uterus). Interstitial brachytherapy involves placing the radiation source directly into the tissue, not a cavity. External beam radiation is delivered from outside the body.

Reasoning: The patient presents with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) due to nodal reentry, which is confirmed by the ECG. The patient is hemodynamically stable (PA 110/65 mmHg, SpO2 99%). Adenosine is the first-line treatment for stable PSVT. While cardioversion is also an option for SVT, it is usually reserved for unstable patients. Atropine would be used in cases of bradycardia.

Reasoning: The description of the lesions (brown, rough, presence of comedo-like openings and pseudocysts) and the dermoscopic image are highly suggestive of pigmented seborrheic keratosis. Melanoma, while important to consider due to the patient's history, is less likely given the dermatoscopic features. Basal cell carcinoma would typically present differently.

Reasoning: The clinical presentation of multiple, raised, light brown lesions with a rough texture on the chest and neck, along with the dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudo-horn cysts, strongly suggests seborrheic keratosis. The pigmentated aspect points toward the pigmented variant. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the features described are not typical for a melanoma recurrence or a new melanoma.

1,IT1044,"Una signora di 67 anni con storia di dispnea da sforzo, mai indagata in precedenza e mai sottoposta ad intervento chirurgico toracico, esegue spirometria. Sulla base dei risultati di seguito riportati quale sindrome disventilatoria è più probabile tra le seguenti?",C,True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning:
The question asks to identify the most probable type of ventilatory defect based on the provided spirometry results. The patient is a 67-year-old female with exertional dyspnea.
Looking at the spirometry results, we see that FVC is 2.38 L (57% of predicted) and FEV1 is 2.03 L (60% of predicted). The FEV1/FVC ratio is 78% (85% of reference). TLC is also low (2.89; 43% of reference). A reduced FVC and TLC with a normal or elevated FEV1/FVC ratio suggests a restrictive ventilatory defect. Thus, option C is the most appropriate answer. Options A, B and D can be easily excluded and E is not directly related to spirometry measures.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The image shows spirometry results indicating a restrictive ventilatory defect. Key findings include a reduced FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) and a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio. This pattern is consistent with restrictive lung diseases where the lung's ability to expand is limited, leading to reduced lung volumes. Therefore, a restrictive ventilatory syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows a slow heart rate, with P waves not clearly associated with the QRS complexes. This suggests a complete heart block (third-degree AV block), and given the patient's symptoms (weakness, headache, dizziness) it is symptomatic. The most appropriate treatment for symptomatic complete heart block is the implantation of a pacemaker.

Reasoning: The ECG shows complete heart block (third-degree AV block), characterized by independent P waves and QRS complexes with no relationship between them. The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness). The appropriate treatment for symptomatic complete heart block is a pacemaker. Therefore, the answer is C. Cardioversion is used for tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is used for hypotension. Stopping the ACE inhibitor is not the right approach here, as the patient is already stable on that medication. Defibrillation is used for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, neither of which is the case here.",True
1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between disease and risk factor in a case-control study. In a case-control study, we cannot calculate relative risk directly, so options A and B are incorrect. Option C is also incorrect as it is not the correct formula for attributable risk. The correct calculation for association in a case-control study is the Odds Ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c) where a is the number of exposed cases, b is the number of exposed controls, c is the number of unexposed cases, and d is the number of unexposed controls.
In this case, a = 250, b = 150, c = 100, and d = 400. So, the OR = (250*400) / (150*100). Option E has this calculation in reverse order as the other way the Odds Ratio can be computed when looking for the odds of exposure if the person has the condition versus the odds of exposure if the person doesn't have the condition which is (150*400)/(250*100).

Therefore, the correct formula is (250*400)/(150*100), which doesn't appear as an option, so the closest is the reverse E.

However, let's recalculate by switching malati and non-malati columns in the contingency table to be :

| | Esposti | Non esposti |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cases (malati) | 250 | 100 |
| Controls (non malati)| 150 | 400 |

Then the odds ratio = (250 * 400) / (100 * 150) = 100000 / 15000 = 6.66
While the reverse E would be (150*100) / (250*400) = 15000/100000 = 0.15

So, given that this is a case-control study, the columns have to be malati/non malati (cases/controls) on top.

The question asks for association between ""disease and risk factor"". So disease needs to be cases (malati) and absence of disease needs to be controls (non malati). Presence of risk factor needs to be ""esposti"" and absence needs to be ""non esposti"". The odds ratio then represents the odds of having the risk factor if the person has the disease versus the odds of having the risk factor if the person does not have the disease.

Thus, the correct formula is Option E.
```
Odds Ratio = (Odds of exposure among cases) / (Odds of exposure among controls)
= (250/100) / (150/400)
= (250 * 400) / (100 * 150)

```
This shows the calculation should match option E, which is equal to

```
(150*100)/(250*400) = (Controls with Exposure/ Cases with Exposure) /  (Controls without Exposure/ Cases without Exposure)

(Controls with Exposure/ Controls without Exposure) /  (Cases with Exposure/ Cases without Exposure) = (150/400) / (250/100)

```

Therefore, Option E is the correct calculation.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between a disease and a risk factor in a case-control study. In a case-control study, we use the Odds Ratio to estimate this association. The Odds Ratio is calculated as (number of cases with the risk factor * number of controls without the risk factor) / (number of cases without the risk factor * number of controls with the risk factor).  The image is not particularly useful, but one assumes that the table contains values for number of cases with/without and number of controls with/without the risk factor. Based on these values and the provided formulas, the correct option is (150*400)/(250*100), so option E is correct.",False

Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain that worsens with breathing, which suggests a pulmonary issue. The CT scan shows a filling defect in the pulmonary artery, indicating a pulmonary embolism. The chest X-ray shows possible signs of pulmonary edema or congestion, which can be associated with pulmonary embolism. Although other options could present with chest pain, the imaging findings strongly suggest pulmonary embolism. The CT scan shows a clear thrombus in the pulmonary artery, supporting the diagnosis. The presence of chest pain that worsens with breathing (pleuritic chest pain) is also typical for pulmonary embolism.
Acute myocarditis could also cause chest pain and dyspnea, but the CT imaging findings are not consistent with myocarditis. Pericardial effusion can present with dyspnea and chest pain, but the chest X-ray and CT scan do not show significant pericardial effusion. Acute myocardial infarction may cause chest pain, but it doesn't typically worsen with breathing and the CT scan findings point towards pulmonary embolism. Aortic dissection also presents with chest pain, but it is usually a severe, tearing chest pain that radiates to the back, which is not mentioned in this case. Moreover, the CT scan findings are more indicative of pulmonary embolism.
Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and the imaging findings (especially the thrombus in the pulmonary artery), the most probable diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain that worsens with breathing. The question mentions a CT scan of the chest with contrast. Considering the symptoms and the use of CT angiography, the most likely diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism. The chest pain associated with breathing is a strong indicator. The other options are less likely, as they wouldn't typically be investigated with a CT angiogram of the chest in the initial evaluation.",False
