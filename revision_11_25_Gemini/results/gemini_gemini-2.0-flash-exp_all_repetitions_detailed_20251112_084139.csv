Reasoning: The ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with absent P waves and fibrillatory waves, which are characteristic of atrial fibrillation. The other options are incorrect because they would show different ECG patterns. Specifically:
- Myocardial infarction (A, C, and D) typically presents with ST segment elevation or depression, Q waves, and T wave changes.

Reasoning: The description mentions an elderly (85 years old) patient with a history of stroke and diabetes, on multiple medications, presenting with widespread urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae, and intense pruritus. The image shows tense bullae on an erythematous base. These features are highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease common in the elderly. The tense bullae are a key feature differentiating it from pemphigus vulgaris (which typically has flaccid bullae). Herpes zoster presents with dermatomal distribution, which is not mentioned here. Contact dermatitis would have a more localized distribution. Impetigo bullosa is typically caused by Staph. aureus and would present differently. Therefore, bullous pemphigoid is the most likely diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke and diabetes, on polypharmacy, presenting with diffuse erythematous urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae, and intense pruritus. These features strongly suggest bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is a common autoimmune blistering disease of the elderly, characterized by tense bullae on an erythematous base, often preceded by urticarial plaques, and associated with intense pruritus. The other options are less likely: Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae and erosions, not tense bullae; Herpes Zoster is usually unilateral and dermatomal, with painful vesicles, not bullae; Contact dermatitis is typically localized and related to exposure to an irritant or allergen; Bullous impetigo is more common in children and presents with superficial, fragile bullae.",True

Reasoning: The clinical picture described in the question and the image are suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid presents with tense blisters on an erythematous base and is intensely pruritic. The diagnostic procedure of choice is a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence to look for antibodies against the basement membrane zone. Option B includes the correct investigations.
The other options are not appropriate in this scenario: A - is for celiac disease, C - is of limited value, D - is for herpes infections, E - is for pemphigus vulgaris.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense bullae containing clear fluid, which are intensely pruritic. This presentation is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure would be a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence, looking for anti-basement membrane antibodies. This is because bullous pemphigoid involves autoantibodies targeting the basement membrane zone of the skin. Option A is incorrect because it is related to celiac disease, options C and D are not specific to bullous diseases, and option E, while including biopsy for histology and immunofluorescence, specifically looks for anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 antibodies, which are more associated with pemphigus vulgaris or foliaceus, not bullous pemphigoid.",True
1,IT0053,"[In uno studio caso-controllo per comprendere l'eziologia del cancro dell'esofago, 870 casi e 902 controlli sono stati indagati per quanto concerne il consumo abituale di superalcolici.] L'associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio può essere quantificata calcolando:",C,True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question asks for the quantification of the association between a risk factor and a disease in a case-control study. In case-control studies, the appropriate measure of association is the Odds Ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a * d) / (b * c), where:
- a = number of exposed cases
- b = number of exposed controls
- c = number of unexposed cases
- d = number of unexposed controls

From the table:
- a = 656
- b = 516
- c = 214
- d = 386

Therefore, the OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214), which corresponds to option C. The image provides the information required to calculate the Odds Ratio. Options A, B, D and E are incorrect because they calculate RA or RR or provide incorrect formulas.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question describes a case-control study. In case-control studies, we cannot directly calculate the relative risk (RR) because we start by selecting individuals based on their disease status. Therefore, we estimate the association between the risk factor (alcohol consumption) and the disease (esophageal cancer) using the odds ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where a is the number of cases with the exposure, d is the number of controls without the exposure, b is the number of cases without the exposure, and c is the number of controls with the exposure. Based on the information provided and the available options, option C corresponds to the formula for calculating OR.
The numbers given in the options appear related to the total of 870 cases and 902 controls. The option C breaks down the totals:
656 = number of cases exposed
386 = number of controls unexposed (902 controls - number of controls exposed = 902 - 516 = 386)
516 = number of controls exposed
214 = number of cases unexposed (870 cases - number of cases exposed = 870 - 656 = 214)
The other options represent different calculations:
RA (risk difference) is not appropriate in this study design. RR (relative risk) is used in cohort studies. Also, options A, B, D, and E do not reflect the correct OR calculation with the given data.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and faster to conduct than other types of studies, such as cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. They are particularly useful for studying rare diseases or diseases with long latency periods. The image provided is a contingency table with data from the case-control study described in the question, and the information about the numbers of exposed and non-exposed individuals among cases (those with esophageal cancer) and controls supports the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of such a study design. Furthermore, case-control studies investigate past exposures, so they cannot directly calculate incidence or prevalence.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally advantageous because they are relatively inexpensive and can be completed in a shorter timeframe compared to other study designs like cohort studies. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because case-control studies are not designed to calculate incidence or prevalence. They are used to investigate potential risk factors for a disease by comparing cases (individuals with the disease) to controls (individuals without the disease).",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6 (anteroseptal leads), which is consistent with an anterior STEMI. The patient's symptoms and risk factors (age, smoking, hypertension) further support this diagnosis. The blood pressure (90/50 mmHg) and heart rate (57 bpm) indicate possible cardiogenic shock and bradycardia, which are also findings associated with acute myocardial infarction. The ECG doesn't show signs of inferior STEMI or pericarditis. While a previous anterior infarct is possible given the risk factors, the ST elevation suggests an acute event. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is anterior STEMI.",False,C,"IT0063, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF), which is indicative of an inferior STEMI. The patient also presents with epigastric pain and hypotension.",True

Reasoning: The patient is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardic (57/min). The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6 and I, aVL indicating an acute anterior STEMI. Given the acute coronary syndrome, Ticagrelor is appropriate as a P2Y12 inhibitor for antiplatelet therapy. Nitroprussiato is a vasodilator that would further decrease blood pressure, Diltiazem will worsen bradycardia and hypotension. Warfarin is contraindicated in the acute setting. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that can be given later, but is not a priority now.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient is a 48-year-old smoker with hypertension on an ACE inhibitor, presenting with epigastric pain for 6 hours. His blood pressure is low (90/50 mmHg) and heart rate is also low (57/min). The ECG is not visible, but the question mentions that the hemodynamics department is being alerted, which suggests a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Given the low blood pressure, vasodilators like nitroprussiate (A) are contraindicated. Diltiazem (B) is a calcium channel blocker that would further lower blood pressure and is also contraindicated. Warfarin (C) is an anticoagulant and not indicated acutely in this situation. Enalapril (E), the patient is already on an ACE inhibitor, and due to the low blood pressure, administration is not appropriate. The patient potentially is having a cardiac event, and an antiplatelet medication is necessary. Ticagrelor (D) is an antiplatelet medication and is appropriate as an initial treatment along with aspirin when there is a suspicion of ACS.",True

Reasoning: The patient is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardic (57/min) which, in the context of epigastric pain and ECG changes, suggests a possible inferior wall myocardial infarction. The ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, which is indicative of an inferior wall MI. Right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion is the most common cause of inferior wall MI, as the RCA supplies the inferior wall of the heart in the majority of individuals. While other arteries could be involved, the most likely culprit given the presentation and ECG findings is the RCA. Moreover, the bradycardia might indicate involvement of the sinus node artery which is typically a branch of the RCA.",True,A,"IT0065, A
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). This pattern is highly suggestive of an inferior wall myocardial infarction, which is typically caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's presentation, including epigastric pain, hypotension, bradycardia, and risk factors (smoking, hypertension), further supports this diagnosis.",True
1,IT0095,"[Un ragazzo di 23 anni è vittima di un incidente automobilistico (moto contro auto). All'arrivo dei soccorsi viene riferito il seguente esame obiettivo neurologico: il paziente giace a occhi chiusi, non li apre né allo stimolo verbale né allo stimolo doloroso, eloquio assente, alla stimolazione algica il paziente tende ad allontanare gli arti dalla fonte dello stimolo. Presenta anisocoria per destra > sinistra.] Il paziente viene trasferito presso il Pronto Soccorso dove viene sottoposto a una TC cerebrale. Quale reperto è verosimilmente apprezzabile alla TC?",C,True,D,"IT0095, D
Reasoning: The patient's neurological examination indicates a severe head injury, with a GCS score likely around 8 or less (eyes closed to pain, localizing to pain, no verbal response). The anisocoria suggests a possible mass effect causing uncal herniation. Given the history of a high-impact motor vehicle accident and the acute presentation, the most likely finding on CT is an acute subdural hematoma. Acute subdural hematomas are often crescent-shaped and can cause significant mass effect, which is consistent with the anisocoria. The image shows such a crescent-shaped hematoma.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's presentation (unresponsive, anisocoria, withdrawal to pain after a high-speed trauma), along with the age and mechanism of injury (motorcycle vs car accident), raises a concern for a traumatic brain injury. Anisocoria indicates possible herniation due to increased intracranial pressure. The most likely finding on CT scan in this scenario would be an intraparenchymal hematoma as it's a common sequelae of a traumatic brain injury. While other options such as epidural or subdural hematomas could be possibilities, the clinical scenario points more towards intraparenchymal bleeding. Chronic subdural hematoma is less likely given the acute presentation. A subgaleal hematoma is possible but would not explain the anisocoria or unresponsiveness as directly. Therefore, intraparenchymal hemorrhage is the most probable finding.",False

Reasoning: The radiograph shows the humeral head anteriorly dislocated relative to the glenoid fossa. This is a classic presentation of anterior shoulder dislocation, which often results from a fall on an outstretched hand. The text also mentions abduction and extension, which are common mechanisms.",True,B,"IT0111, B
Reasoning: The description points to a common mechanism of injury for anterior shoulder dislocation (glenohumeral joint). The patient fell on an outstretched hand with the shoulder abducted and extended. This often leads to the humeral head dislocating anteriorly. The other options are less likely given this mechanism and the commonality of anterior shoulder dislocations. A trochiter fracture is possible but less typical as a primary injury from this fall mechanism. Acromioclavicular dislocations involve a direct blow to the shoulder. Glenoid fractures are often associated with high-energy trauma. Posterior dislocations are rare and associated with seizures or electrocution.",True

Reasoning: The image shows the vertebral bodies and spinal cord in a side view. This indicates a sagittal plane. The vertebral bodies are well-defined, suggesting a pure sagittal plane. Options D and E involve oblique angles, which are not apparent in this image. Option B (coronal) would show an anterior view, and Option C (axial) would show a cross-sectional view of the spine.",True,A,"IT0130, A
Reasoning: The image shows a sagittal view of the lumbar spine. We can see the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other from a lateral perspective, which is characteristic of a sagittal plane. Options D and E are specific types of sagittal oblique views, but since the image displays a standard lateral view of the spine, option A is the most appropriate choice.",True

Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate examination to identify the presence of bone metastases, given a possible finding on an MRI of the lumbar spine. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is a sensitive method for detecting bone metastases. It is more sensitive than plain radiographs or CT scans for detecting early bone changes.
While a TC of the entire spine or skeleton could also identify metastases, a bone scan is generally the preferred initial examination for this purpose.
Ultrasound is not suitable for detecting bone metastases.
Therefore, a bone scan is the most appropriate option.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks about the most appropriate investigation to identify the presence of bone metastases. While CT scans can be useful, a bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is generally the first-line investigation for detecting bone metastases because it is highly sensitive to changes in bone metabolism, which occur when metastases are present. It can detect metastases throughout the entire skeleton. Options B, C, and E involve CT scans, which are often used as a second-line investigation if further characterization is needed. Ultrasound is not appropriate for widespread skeletal screening.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a loss of the typical folds and a flattened appearance of the intestinal mucosa, which is indicative of mucosal atrophy. The question mentions malabsorption, and villous atrophy is a common cause of malabsorption. There are no visible signs of fistulas, abscesses, neoformation, bleeding, or ulcers.",True,B,"IT0136, B
Reasoning: The image shows a flattened mucosa with reduced or absent villi, indicative of mucosal atrophy. This is a common finding in malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that there is an atrophy of the mucosa. The other options are not supported by the endoscopic image provided. There are no visible fistulas, abscesses, neoformations, bleeding, or ulcers.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with eritemato-ipercheratosiche lesions, nummular in shape, on the scapular region. There are also ipercheratosiche lesions with cicatricial alopecia on the scalp. The lesions on the trunk, which have been present for a long time, tend to cicatricial atrophy and leave hyperpigmented sequelae, especially peripherally. All lesions tend to worsen after sun exposure. This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE). Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for DLE.

Reasoning: The histological findings of villous atrophy (flattening of villi), crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes are highly suggestive of celiac disease. These are classic features seen in intestinal biopsies of patients with celiac disease. Whipple's disease is characterized by PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria.

Reasoning: The histological findings described—villous atrophy (flattening of villi), crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes—are classic hallmarks of celiac disease. Whipple's disease is characterized by PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria. Crohn's disease typically shows transmural inflammation and granulomas. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not typically demonstrate these histological changes. Neuroendocrine tumors of the small intestine do not present with these histological findings.

Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows multiple well-defined, round opacities of varying sizes scattered throughout both lung fields. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice. The shapes are too large and not diffuse enough for miliary tuberculosis. A multi-focal pneumonia would have more diffuse infiltrates, not the well-defined borders we see. Atelectasis typically presents as a loss of volume in the lung, with a more collapsed appearance, and is not typically visualized as multiple rounded opacities. The shadows are clearly not ECG electrode shadows.",True,E,"IT0200, E
Reasoning: The image shows multiple small, round densities scattered throughout the lung fields. These densities are located near the surface of the chest and are equidistant, suggesting they are not located within the lung parenchyma. The clinical context involves a preoperative assessment, which would likely involve an ECG. Given the appearance and distribution, the densities are most consistent with the shadows of ECG electrodes.",False

Reasoning: The rhythm shows a rapid, irregular waveform with varying morphologies. The QRS complexes are wide and bizarre, and there is no clear P wave. The complexes vary in shape and amplitude, characteristic of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsades de Pointes). The preceding history of chest pain and loss of consciousness are consistent with a life-threatening arrhythmia.
A is incorrect because in Supraventricular tachycardia the QRS complex is often narrow.

Reasoning: The image shows a body in advanced stages of decomposition, including skin slippage, bloating, and the presence of insect activity (maggots). The text mentions the complete resolution of rigor mortis. Considering these factors, a time frame of approximately 3-5 days since death seems most consistent with the presented evidence. Rigor mortis typically resolves within this timeframe. Less than 24 hours is unlikely given the advanced decomposition. A month or longer would likely show a more skeletonized state. A year or three months would show a skeleton or mummified body. Therefore, 3-5 days appears to be the best answer.",True,A,"IT0229, A

Reasoning: The patient's symptoms (sudden onset headache, vomiting, aphasia, right hemiparesis) and medical history (hypertension, liver cirrhosis) suggest a possible hemorrhagic stroke. The CT scan shows a hyperdense lesion in the left frontoparietal region, consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The left hemisphere is affected, which correlates with the patient's right-sided weakness and aphasia.
A) An epidural hematoma would typically be associated with trauma, which is not mentioned here. Also, its appearance on CT is different.
B) While the CT scan shows some spread to the parietal region, the description 'acute' doesn't fit as well given the patient's chronic conditions potentially complicating the situation.
D) An ischemic stroke is less likely given the sudden onset headache and vomiting. The CT image shows hyperdensity suggestive of blood, not hypodensity suggestive of ischemia (at this early stage).
E) Subarachnoid hemorrhage often presents with a thunderclap headache and may not be so clearly localized. Furthermore, the CT appearance is not typical of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal region.",True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient's symptoms (sudden headache, vomiting, aphasia, right hemiparesis) along with the history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis strongly suggest a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The CT scan (even without contrast) would likely show a hyperdense area in the brain parenchyma, consistent with blood. Given the left aphasia and right hemiparesis, the most probable location is the left fronto-parietal region. Epidural and subdural hematomas are usually associated with trauma. While subarachnoid hemorrhage could cause sudden headache, the focal neurological deficits are more consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Ischemic stroke is less likely given the sudden onset of headache and vomiting.",True

The MRI shows an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal region with homogeneous contrast enhancement and a dural tail. These characteristics are highly suggestive of a meningioma. Gliomas are typically intra-axial, metastases are less likely to have a dural tail, subdural hematomas are typically crescent-shaped and do not enhance like this, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages do not usually appear as well-defined extra-axial masses with a dural tail. Given the location described in the question is in the right frontal region, the correct answer is meningioma of the frontale right, however given that option A states ""Meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra"" (Meningioma of the left frontal convexity) the answer could be wrong.

The MRI findings indicate an extra-axial lesion that enhances vividly and homogeneously with contrast and has a dural tail. This is most characteristic of a meningioma. Meningiomas are typically benign tumors arising from the meninges. Given the location as frontale destro and the symptoms, a meningioma of the right frontal convexity is most likely. The lesion causes symptoms on the same side because it's compressing the motor cortex on the right, leading to the left motor deficit. Since the aphasia is reported (difficoltà nell'eloquio) and the deficit is in the right hemisphere, it would affect expressive language on the right side.

A) Meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra - INCORRECT, the question specifically states the lesion is on the right side causing the symptoms.
B) Glioma frontale sinistro di alto grado - INCORRECT, Gliomas are intra-axial, not extra-axial, and usually do not show a dural tail. The symptoms are referred to the right side.
C) Metastasi temporale destra da carcinoma mammario - INCORRECT, while metastases can occur, the ""dural tail"" is not typical.
D) Ematoma sottodurale acuto fronto-parietale sinistro - INCORRECT, an acute subdural hematoma would have a different appearance on MRI and is unlikely to enhance homogeneously. The symptoms reported are on the right side.
E) Emorragia intraparenchimale spontanea frontale destra - INCORRECT, an intraparenchymal hemorrhage would have a different appearance on MRI and is unlikely to enhance homogeneously or show a dural tail.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense, predominantly nocturnal thigh pain that resolves with aspirin. This clinical picture, along with the radiographic findings showing a small, round lucency (nidus) surrounded by sclerosis in the femur, is highly suggestive of an osteoid osteoma. The response to aspirin is also a key characteristic of this tumor.

Reasoning: The clinical presentation of a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly nocturnal, relieved by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. Osteoid osteomas are known to cause pain that is worse at night and responsive to NSAIDs due to prostaglandin production. The other options are less likely: chondroblastoma typically occurs in the epiphysis of long bones; chondrosarcoma is a malignant cartilage tumor, less likely in this age group and not typically relieved by aspirin; osteosarcoma is a more aggressive bone tumor usually not relieved by aspirin; and enchondroma is a benign cartilage tumor that is usually asymptomatic.",True

Reasoning: The question describes papules in the perineal region that are likely condyloma acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgical therapy are all appropriate treatments for genital warts. Salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not the correct treatment, and in some cases could cause the warts to spread. Therefore, topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids is NOT indicated.",True,E,"IT0311, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with perineal pinkish-brown papules that sometimes merge into plaques, asymptomatic. This description is suggestive of condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Treatments like sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, surgery, and imiquimod are used for genital warts. Topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are typically not used for condylomata acuminata and might even worsen the condition.

Reasoning: The question describes an elderly patient with irregular heartbeat detected during blood pressure self-monitoring. The ECG needs to be analyzed. Looking at the ECG strips (which are unfortunately very low resolution), there are P waves followed by QRS complexes, but there are also P waves not followed by QRS complexes.

Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy and presents with dyspnea for 5 hours. His blood pressure is 100/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 88%. These signs, along with the ECG which shows sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation and S1Q3T3 pattern (prominent S wave in lead I, a Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III), are highly suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. The recent surgery is a risk factor for DVT/PE. Hypotension and hypoxemia are also consistent with PE. While heart failure could be considered, the acute onset of dyspnea and the ECG findings point more strongly to PE. Anemia is less likely to cause this sudden onset of severe dyspnea, particularly with hypoxemia, and would not explain the ECG findings. Brugada syndrome doesn't fit the clinical presentation. Aortic dissection is possible, but the ECG and hypoxemia point towards PE. Therefore, acute pulmonary embolism is the most probable diagnosis.",True

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a fracture involving the intertrochanteric region of the left femur. A subcapital fracture would be at the neck of the femur, a transcervical fracture would cross the neck, and a subtrochanteric fracture is below the trochanters. A cervico-trochanteric fracture is not a recognized term. Therefore, the correct answer is a pertrochanteric fracture of the left femur.",False,B,"IT0507, B

Reasoning: The patient presents with difficulty walking, speech disturbances, and right-sided weakness (slivellamento dell'arto superiore e inferiore di destra). He has a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and a head trauma 4 weeks prior. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is isodense/hypodense compared to the brain parenchyma. The crescent shape of the hematoma and the temporal relationship of symptoms appearing weeks after a trauma, and the iso-ipodense appearance strongly suggests a chronic subdural hematoma. Warfarin use also increases the risk of bleeding with even minor trauma. An acute hematoma would be hyperdense on CT. An epidural hematoma would typically have a lenticular shape. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage would be within the brain tissue itself, and subarachnoid hemorrhage would appear in the subarachnoid space.",True,A,"IT0512, A
Reasoning: The patient's history includes a fall resulting in head trauma four weeks prior, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation (and warfarin use), progressive neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech problems), and examination findings of expressive aphasia and right-sided weakness. The CT scan reveals a crescent-shaped hematoma that is isodense to hypodense compared to the brain parenchyma. This strongly suggests a chronic subdural hematoma. The crescent shape is typical for subdural hematomas, and the density suggests a chronic bleed (as acute bleeds are typically hyperdense). Given the warfarin use and the recent fall, a subdural hematoma is the most likely diagnosis. A chronic hematoma is more likely than an acute hematoma because it typically takes time for the hematoma to produce the progressive neurological findings.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (chest pain, diaphoresis, jugular constriction) and is also hypertensive and dyslipidemic, increasing the risk of cardiac events. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4), which indicates an acute anterior myocardial infarction. Given the clinical presentation and the ECG findings, the next step should be immediate coronary angiography (<2 hours) to identify and treat the culprit lesion. Angio-CT is not the gold standard in acute cases. Serial troponins are useful but will delay the management. Testing for inflammatory markers and viral antigens is not warranted. Delaying angiography to within 24 hours is also not recommended.",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, profuse sweating, jugular constriction, hypertension, and good oxygen saturation. Given the symptoms and the patient's risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia), the most likely diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG is crucial for determining the appropriate management. Without seeing the ECG, assuming it shows signs of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or a new left bundle branch block (LBBB), the immediate next step is emergent coronary angiography (<2 hours) to identify and treat the culprit lesion. Even if the ECG shows NSTE-ACS (Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome) features, such as ST depression or T wave inversion, given the severity of the symptoms, early invasive strategy (coronary angiography) within 24 hours would be appropriate. However, because the symptoms seem critical (jugular constriction, profuse sweating) with strong suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, emergent coronary angiography is the most appropriate action.
Therefore, coronary angiography is the correct and most time-sensitive intervention. Angio-CT and Troponin levels are useful but secondary to quickly finding the stenosis. The other choices are not appropriate in the context of a potential ACS.",True

Reasoning: The clinical picture of a 75-year-old man with cardiovascular disease and hypertension complaining of sudden vision loss in the right eye (OD) combined with the fundus photograph showing diffuse retinal hemorrhages (""blood and thunder"" appearance), dilated and tortuous veins, and possibly some cotton wool spots is strongly suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The hemorrhages are present in all four quadrants.
Options A, C, D, and E are less likely given the clinical context and fundus appearance. The pattern of hemorrhage in CRVO is far more diffuse than would typically be seen in BRVO. While diabetes is a factor in diabetic retinopathy, the appearance of the fundus is more consistent with CRVO than diabetic retinopathy. Given his age, macular degeneration is a possibility, but the fundus photo clearly shows more than just macular changes. Central serous retinopathy is typically a younger person's diagnosis and is not seen with widespread retinal hemorrhages.",True,B,"IT0653, B
Reasoning: The clinical picture of a 75-year-old hypertensive patient with sudden visual loss in one eye, combined with the fundus photograph showing widespread hemorrhages, dilated and tortuous veins, strongly suggests central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The hemorrhages are scattered throughout the retina, which distinguishes it from branch retinal vein occlusion. The age also makes AMD (age-related macular degeneration) a less probable initial diagnosis and fundus image doesn't show signs of exudates or drusen typical of AMD.

Reasoning: The symptoms (regurgitation, dysphagia) and the radiological image are highly suggestive of achalasia. The image shows a characteristic ""bird's beak"" appearance of the distal esophagus due to the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. The other options are less likely to present with these combined features. GIST would usually be detected by endoscopy and imaging. A hiatal hernia could cause symptoms similar to GERD.

The X-ray appearance is classic for a massive pneumothorax. A broncho-pneumonic focus wouldn't explain the complete lack of lung markings nor the mediastinal shift. Pleural effusion would present a different pattern on the X-ray (blunting of the costophrenic angle with a meniscus sign). Scompenso cardiaco would cause bilateral pulmonary edema.",True,A,"IT0861, A
Reasoning: The clinical presentation (left anterior chest pain worsened by breathing, tachypnea, reduced breath sounds on the left), blood gas analysis (low pH, low PaO2, low PaCO2 - suggesting respiratory distress/compensation), and the chest X-ray (showing a large area of hyperlucency in the left hemithorax with absence of lung markings and a shift of the mediastinum to the right) strongly suggest a massive left-sided pneumothorax. The X-ray findings are classic for this condition. This requires urgent chest tube placement.",True
1,IT0890,"Giunge in ambulatorio un uomo di 32 anni con prurito diffuso senza interessamento del capo presente da due settimane. Riferisce che il prurito è più accentuato nelle ore notturne. Alla valutazione clinica sono presenti papule, alcune escoriate, e lesioni da grattamento. Alla faccia laterale del secondo dito di una mano si osservano lesioni lineari di circa un centimetro di lunghezza con una piccola papula ad una estremità. Quale tra le seguenti è la prima patologia che si deve sospettare?",E,True,E,"IT0890, E
Reasoning: The description of diffuse itching, worse at night, with papules, excoriations, and linear lesions (burrows) on the side of the finger is highly suggestive of scabies. The image supports this diagnosis as well, where the linear lesions can be observed. Pediculosis usually involves the scalp. Urticaria presents with wheals. Bullous pemphigoid causes blisters. Cutaneous leishmaniasis causes ulcers.",True,E,"IT0890, E
Reasoning: The key elements suggesting scabies are: diffuse itching sparing the head, worse at night, papules, excoriations, scratch marks, and linear lesions (burrows) with a papule at one end, typically found in the interdigital spaces. Pediculosis typically affects the scalp, body, or pubic area. Urticaria presents with wheals. Bullous pemphigoid presents with large blisters. Cutaneous leishmaniasis presents with ulcers.",True
1,IT0891,"Giunge al reparto di dermatologia una paziente di 60 anni con eruzione maculo-papulosa morbilliforme diffusa, edema del volto, intenso prurito e febbre elevata. Tre settimane prima aveva iniziato un trattamento con allopurinolo. Si eseguono esami ematici con riscontro di ipereosinofilia (2000/mm3), linfociti atipici (più del 5%), aumento di transaminasi, lipasi e amilasi. Il quadro clinico è compatibile con:",C,True,C,"IT0891, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with a maculopapular morbilliform eruption, facial edema, pruritus, and fever after starting allopurinol. Lab findings show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated transaminases, lipasi, and amilasi. These findings are highly suggestive of Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. The image also demonstrates facial edema, which is a common symptom of DRESS syndrome.

SDRIFE typically presents with symmetric involvement of intertriginous and flexural areas, which is not the primary description here. Nicolau dermatitis is an iatrogenic cutaneous adverse reaction caused by injection of different medications and not necessarily related to a generalized rash and systemic symptoms. AGEP is characterized by numerous small, non-follicular pustules on an erythematous background, which is not the primary description of the patient's eruption. Sezary syndrome is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and while it can present with erythroderma, it's not typically associated with the specific lab findings or the drug history described in the question. Therefore, DRESS is the most appropriate diagnosis.",True,C,"IT0891, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with a morbilliform maculopapular eruption, facial edema, intense pruritus, and fever after starting allopurinol. Lab results show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver enzymes, lipase, and amylase. These findings are highly suggestive of Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome.
A) Symmetrical Drug-Related Intertriginous and Flexural Exanthema (SDRIFE) - SDRIFE presents with erythema in intertriginous areas and flexural folds. This is not the primary finding.
B) Dermatite livedoide di Nicolau - This is characterized by painful, necrotic skin lesions, which doesn't fit the described presentation.
C) Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) - This syndrome fits the case scenario because of the rash, fever, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, systemic involvement (liver, pancreas), and drug exposure.
D) Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) - This is characterized by numerous small, sterile pustules on an erythematous base, and the rash develops rapidly. This is not described in the case.
E) Sindrome di Sezary - This is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that presents with erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and circulating malignant T cells, which are not described here.",True
1,IT0892,Allo striscio di sangue periferico si osserva questa morfologia eritrocitaria con schistociti. Il quadro è indicativo di:,E,True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The image shows schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on a peripheral blood smear. Schistocytes are characteristically seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and HELLP syndrome. Other options are less likely to demonstrate schistocytes, although some fragmented cells might be present in other hemolytic conditions. Therefore, option E, microangiopathy trombotica, is the most appropriate.",True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The question describes schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on a peripheral blood smear. Schistocytes are a hallmark of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is associated with thrombotic microangiopathies. Therefore, Microangiopatia trombotica (Thrombotic microangiopathy) is the most appropriate answer.",True
1,IT0908,Un paziente di 85 anni giunge all’ambulatorio di Endoscopia Digestiva per eseguire una esofagogastroduodenoscopia (EGDS) in seguito a riferita emissione di feci scure con riscontro agli esami ematochimici di anemia (Hb:8 g/dL) ipocromica microcitica. L’EGDS mostra in sede antrale il quadro riportato. Qual è la diagnosi endoscopica di quanto osservato?,A,True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The question describes a patient with melena (dark stools) and anemia, suggesting an upper GI bleed. The endoscopy shows a lesion in the antrum of the stomach. The image shows an ulcer with a visible flat spot covered with clot, which corresponds to a Forrest IIc ulcer classification. Forrest IIc indicates a flat spot covered with clot, which indicates a lower risk of re-bleeding compared to Forrest I (active bleeding) and Forrest IIa (visible vessel). Forrest III indicates a clean base, suggesting minimal bleeding risk. A hyperplastic polyp is unlikely to cause the described presentation. A diverticulum doesn't fit with the presentation nor the appearance on the endoscopy picture.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and anemia, suggesting a bleeding lesion in the upper GI tract. The EGDS shows a lesion in the antrum of the stomach. The options include gastric ulcer with different Forrest classifications, hyperplastic polyp, and diverticulum. Based on the image, a crater-like ulcer is visible with a flat, pigmented spot at the base, suggestive of a Forrest IIc ulcer. The Forrest classification describes the endoscopic appearance of bleeding ulcers and their risk of rebleeding. Forrest IIc ulcers have a low risk of rebleeding, which fits the patient's presentation. The patient is bleeding, and Forrest I is active spurting, oozing, or visible vessel. This is not described and not seen in the image. Forrest III means no signs of recent bleeding. A polyp would be an elevated lesion. A diverticulum of the antrum is very rare and would not typically cause anemia and melena unless inflamed or ulcerated. Based on the image and the patient's presentation, Forrest IIc ulcer is the most likely diagnosis.",True

Alla luce del quadro clinico ed elettrocardiografico, quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",E,True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, which indicates an anterior STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction). The patient's clinical presentation, including chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting, further supports this diagnosis. Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia can be seen in acute MI. While we are waiting for troponin results, the ECG strongly suggests a STEMI, requiring immediate intervention. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is STEMI.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, bradycardia, and extrasystoles. He also has nausea and vomiting. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation. These findings suggest STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction). Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is STEMI.",True
1,IT0949,"Una paziente di 56 anni è affetta da carcinoma squamocellulare della cervice uterina, inoperabile per estesa infiltrazione dei paramétri. Il trattamento programmato consiste in una chemioradioterapia.

Come si definisce quest’ultima tecnica di trattamento?",E,True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes the placement of an applicator loaded with Iridium-192 sources into the vagina and uterus. This is a clear description of intracavitary brachytherapy, where radioactive sources are placed within a body cavity.
A) Interstitial brachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources directly into the tumor tissue.
B) External beam radiation therapy involves delivering radiation from outside the body.
C) Radioimmunotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses antibodies to deliver radiation directly to cancer cells.
D) Intraoperative radiation therapy involves delivering radiation during surgery.",True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes the placement of an applicator containing Iridium-192 within the vagina and uterus. This is a type of brachytherapy where the radiation source is placed inside a body cavity (intracavitary). Therefore, the correct answer is intracavitary brachytherapy.",True
1,IT0972,"Una donna di 32 anni, si reca in Pronto Soccorso per cardiopalmo. APR negativa. All’esame obiettivo: GCS 15/15, SpO2 99% in aria ambiente, FR 29 minuto, PA 110/65 mmHg, FC 180 bpm.

Alla luce del quadro ECG e dei parametri vitali quale tra i seguenti è l’intervento terapeutico più appropriato?",E,True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) likely due to AV nodal re-entry. Given the stable vital signs (GCS 15/15, SpO2 99%, BP 110/65 mmHg), the first-line treatment is vagal maneuvers followed by adenosine. Atropine and Isoproterenol are not used to treat SVT and would worsen the situation. KCl is not indicated in this situation. Synchronized cardioversion is reserved for unstable patients.",True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Adenosine is the first-line treatment for PSVT as it can interrupt the re-entry circuit in the AV node. While cardioversion is an option, it is usually reserved for unstable patients or those who don't respond to adenosine. Atropine is used for bradycardia, isoproterenol is a beta agonist and can worsen the tachycardia. KCl is not indicated in this case.",True
1,IT1022,"Un uomo di 73 anni, seguito per un pregresso melanoma del dorso, presenta ad un controllo programmato una neoformazione della regione sottoclavicolare destra, nettamente aumentata dall’ultimo controllo, di circa 3 cm di diametro, rilevata, di colore marrone chiaro, ruvida al tatto. Sono presenti altre neoformazioni simili, di diametro minore, sia a livello del torace che del collo. Alla dermatoscopia si apprezzano sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee. Quale diagnosi suggeriscono la clinica e la dermatoscopia?",D,True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description mentions a lesion with rapid growth (""nettamente aumentata dall’ultimo controllo""), a rough surface (""ruvida al tatto""), and the presence of ""sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee"" on dermatoscopy. These findings are highly suggestive of seborrheic keratosis. Although the patient has a history of melanoma, the dermatoscopic features described point towards a benign lesion. The image also supports the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis due to the comedo-like openings and the overall appearance. Therefore, pigmented seborrheic keratosis is the most likely diagnosis.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description points towards seborrheic keratosis. The key indicators are:
- Multiple lesions, including smaller ones on the chest and neck.
- ""Sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici"" (comedo-like follicular openings) and ""pseudo-cisti cornee"" (horn pseudocysts) seen under dermatoscopy, which are characteristic features of seborrheic keratosis.
- The color is described as light brown.

While the patient has a history of melanoma, the dermatoscopic findings are more consistent with seborrheic keratosis. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate choice.",True
