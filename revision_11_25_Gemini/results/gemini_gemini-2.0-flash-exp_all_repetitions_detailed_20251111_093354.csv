Reasoning: The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy who presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense bullae with clear content and intense pruritus. These clinical features, especially the age of the patient and the tense bullae, strongly suggest bullous pemphigoid. Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement. Herpes zoster typically presents with painful vesicles in a dermatomal distribution. Contact dermatitis is usually more localized and not associated with tense bullae. Bullous impetigo is more common in children and presents with superficial bullae. The image shows tense bullae consistent with bullous pemphigoid.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy who presents with widespread urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled blisters with intense pruritus. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is more common in the elderly and often presents with a prodrome of urticarial plaques before the development of tense bullae. The intense pruritus is also a characteristic feature. While other diagnoses could be considered, bullous pemphigoid is the most likely given the information provided. Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement, which is not described here. Herpes zoster typically presents with a dermatomal distribution, which is not described in this case. Contact dermatitis would be unlikely to be so widespread. Impetigo bullosa would typically be associated with a bacterial infection and would not necessarily present with such intense pruritus.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with tense bullae on an erythematous base, suggesting a bullous dermatosis. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) to identify the specific disease. Option B is preferred over E because it specifies searching for antibodies anti-basement membrane, which is particularly relevant for bullous pemphigoid, a common bullous dermatosis in the elderly.
Options A, C and D are not specific or comprehensive enough to establish the diagnosis.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense bullae, which are intensely pruritic. This clinical presentation suggests a bullous dermatosis, such as bullous pemphigoid. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure would be a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to identify the specific antibodies and their location within the skin. Searching for anti-basement membrane antibodies is important to distinguish bullous pemphigoid from other bullous diseases. Option A is for celiac disease. Option C is not the most informative.

Reasoning: Since this is a case-control study, we cannot calculate the relative risk (RR). We can, however, calculate the odds ratio (OR).
OR = (odds of exposure among cases) / (odds of exposure among controls) = (656/214) / (516/386) = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). This matches option C.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question describes a case-control study. In case-control studies, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between exposure and outcome. The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of cases with exposure, 'b' is the number of cases without exposure, 'c' is the number of controls with exposure, and 'd' is the number of controls without exposure. The values 656, 214 can be assigned to cells 'a' and 'c'. The numbers 516 and 386 were derived from 870-656 and 902-516, so these must be cells 'b' and 'd'.
Option C, (656 · 386) / (516 · 214), correctly represents the calculation of the odds ratio. Options A, B, D, and E represent risk difference and relative risk, and therefore are incorrect.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and the ECG shows signs suggestive of an inferior STEMI (ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF). Given the suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and the imminent transfer to the cath lab, antiplatelet therapy is crucial. Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor used as part of dual antiplatelet therapy in ACS. Nitroprussiate would further lower the BP, Diltiazem is inappropriate due to the bradycardia, Warfarin is an anticoagulant and inappropriate at this stage, Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor the patient is already taking and is not the priority. Therefore, Ticagrelor is the most appropriate immediate action, after alerting the cath lab.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and the ECG (although not visible) warrants alerting the cath lab, suggesting an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically an inferior STEMI given the epigastric pain. Given the potential need for PCI, a P2Y12 inhibitor like ticagrelor should be started to prevent platelet aggregation. Nitroprussiato is contraindicated in hypotensive patients. Diltiazem can cause bradycardia. Warfarin is not appropriate for the acute setting. Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, would further worsen the hypotension.",True

Reasoning: The patient is a young male involved in a motor vehicle accident with decreased level of consciousness (GCS of around 7-9 based on description: eyes closed, no eye opening to verbal or painful stimuli, no verbal response, withdrawal to pain). He has anisocoria (unequal pupils) which is a sign of potential increased intracranial pressure. The CT image shows a hyperdense (bright white) crescent shaped lesion conforming to the shape of the skull but not crossing suture lines, consistent with an acute subdural hematoma. An epidural hematoma would likely appear lens-shaped and potentially cross suture lines. Intraparenchymal hematoma would be within the brain tissue. Chronic subdural hematomas appear hypodense (darker) on CT. Subgaleal hematomas are located outside the skull. Given the clinical presentation and the appearance on CT, acute subdural hematoma is the most likely finding.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's presentation, including being unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli, an absent speech, withdrawal response to pain, and anisocoria (right > left), strongly suggests a significant intracranial injury following a motor vehicle accident. Given the acute nature of the trauma, an intraparenchymal hematoma (A) is a likely finding on a CT scan in this situation. Subdural and epidural hematomas (options B, C, and D) are also possible, but the question specifies the ""most likely"" finding. Intraparenchymal hemorrhages are common in traumatic brain injury, especially with high-impact mechanisms like motor vehicle accidents. A subgaleal hematoma (E) is less likely to be the primary cause of the neurological deficits.",False

Reasoning: The X-ray shows that the humeral head is anteriorly dislocated relative to the glenoid fossa. The patient's mechanism of injury (fall on an outstretched hand with the shoulder in abduction and extension) is also consistent with an anterior shoulder dislocation. The image depicts the humeral head being positioned anterior to the glenoid fossa.
Therefore, the correct answer is anterior glenohumeral dislocation.",True,B,"IT0111, B
Reasoning: The question describes a 37-year-old male presenting to the ER with intense pain in his right shoulder following a fall onto his palm with the shoulder in slight abduction and extension. This mechanism of injury is highly suggestive of an anterior shoulder dislocation (luxazione anteriore dell'articolazione gleno-omerale). Anterior dislocations are the most common type of shoulder dislocation. The image is blank, so it does not provide any information. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is anterior glenohumeral joint dislocation.",True

Reasoning: The image shows the lumbar spine in a side view, displaying the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other, the spinal cord running vertically, and the intervertebral discs between the vertebrae. This view is characteristic of a sagittal plane. Since the image is not angled, it is a pure sagittal plane.",True,A,"IT0130, A
Reasoning: The MRI image shows a lateral view of the lumbar spine, clearly depicting the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other. This indicates that the image is in the sagittal plane. Since the vertebral bodies are aligned, it's a sagittal plane close to midline i.e., a ""pure"" sagittal plane.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a patient with lower back pain unresponsive to anti-inflammatory drugs, and the MRI reveals a possible bone metastasis. The question asks which is the most appropriate test to identify the presence of bone metastases. A bone scan is the most sensitive test to detect bone metastases. While other options may be useful, bone scans are generally the first-line investigation for suspected widespread bone metastases.
CT scans can be helpful in visualizing the bones, but are not as sensitive as bone scans for detecting subtle metastatic lesions. Also, while the image is indicative of bone metastases, it doesn't show them directly, it only suggests they might be present.
Therefore A, Scintigrafia ossea, is the best option.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 45-year-old patient with lower back pain that hasn't responded to anti-inflammatory drugs. An MRI reveals a possible bone metastasis. The question asks the most appropriate investigation to identify bone metastases. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is the most appropriate imaging technique for detecting the presence of bone metastases. While CT scans can visualize metastases, bone scans are more sensitive for detecting early bone involvement and are typically used as a screening tool. The other options are less efficient: CT of the entire spine is insufficient; Ultrasound is operator-dependent and less sensitive for detecting bony changes deep within the bone marrow; low dose CT is less sensitive than bone scan.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a gastroscopy view with flattened intestinal folds. The patient has malabsorption symptoms. The findings suggest villous atrophy of the mucosa, which reduces the surface area for nutrient absorption. Therefore, the most likely answer is B. The other options are not supported by the endoscopic findings. There is no evidence of fistulas, abscesses, neoformation, bleeding, or ulceration.",True,B,"IT0136, B
Reasoning: The image shows a flat, almost featureless mucosa. This appearance is characteristic of mucosal atrophy, such as that seen in celiac disease or other malabsorptive disorders. The absence of normal folds and villi suggests that the mucosa has undergone atrophy.",True

Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows multiple, well-defined, rounded opacities in both lung fields. These are highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases (""cannonball metastases""). The options A, C and D are less likely based on the image. Option E is absurd.
Miliary tuberculosis presents as diffuse, small nodules.

Atelectasis would present as a collapsed lung segment.
The appearance of the ECG electrode artifacts would not appear as such clearly defined round nodules.
Therefore, the best answer is B.",True,B,"IT0200, B
Reasoning: The image shows multiple, well-defined, rounded opacities throughout both lung fields. This is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases. The other options are less likely given the appearance. Miliary tuberculosis typically presents with smaller, more diffuse nodules. Pneumonia would likely show consolidation. Atelectasis involves volume loss and would have a different appearance. The electrodes of an ECG should be along the surface of the body, therefore the shadows wouldn't appear to be in the internal lung fields.",True

Reasoning: The image shows significant decomposition signs, including skin slippage, bloating, and insect activity (maggots). Given that the rigor mortis has resolved and considering the environmental conditions (August in Sicily, likely warm), the decomposition would be accelerated. The level of decomposition shown is consistent with approximately 3-5 days post-mortem. Options C, D, and E suggest significantly longer periods, which are inconsistent with the observed features. Option B suggests less than 24 hours, which is not enough time for this level of decomposition to occur, especially given the warm environment.",True,A,"IT0229, A
Reasoning: The question states that rigor mortis has completely resolved. Rigor mortis typically resolves within 36-72 hours (1.5-3 days) after death.

Reasoning: The patient's presentation (sudden headache, vomiting, aphasia, right hemiparesis in a hypertensive and alcoholic patient with cirrhosis) suggests a hemorrhagic stroke. The CT scan shows a large hyperdense lesion in the left frontoparietal region, indicative of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The location corresponds to the clinical deficits (aphasia and right hemiparesis due to involvement of language and motor areas in the left hemisphere). An epidural hematoma would be less likely given the patient's age and the shape of the bleed on the CT. A subdural hematoma would also be less likely given the acute presentation and the lens shape more consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. While ischemic stroke is possible, the sudden onset of headache and vomiting favors hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage would typically present with a different CT appearance and is less likely given the focal neurological deficits.",True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis, along with a history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis. Examination reveals sopor, global aphasia, and right hemiplegia. The CT scan (although the image is missing here), given the sudden onset of symptoms, hypertension history and cirrhosis (which impacts coagulation) points toward a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left fronto-parietal region, which would cause the right hemiplegia and aphasia. An epidural hematoma would typically be associated with trauma. Subdural hematomas can be acute but less likely in the absence of trauma. Ischemic stroke is a possibility, but the sudden onset of headache and vomiting is more typical of hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage can cause similar symptoms but is not usually associated with aphasia and hemiparesis without other neurological deficits. The clinical picture is more consistent with an intracerebral hemorrhage.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and expressive aphasia. MRI shows an extra-axial, contrast-enhancing lesion in the right frontal area with dural tail.
A meningioma is a common extra-axial tumor that arises from the meninges. Meningiomas are typically slow-growing and can cause symptoms related to compression of the surrounding brain tissue. The dural tail sign is a characteristic feature of meningiomas. The patient's symptoms (progressive weakness and aphasia) and the MRI findings (extra-axial lesion, contrast enhancement, dural tail) are consistent with a meningioma. Since the lesion is on the right frontal lobe, the weakness is on the right and expressive aphasia is more likely with left frontal lesions (though the right lobe can sometimes also affect speech). However, option A refers to left frontal. Looking at the image, the lesion is on the right frontal lobe. Hence A must be a typographical error.

B: Gliomas are intra-axial tumors that arise from the brain parenchyma. They typically do not have a dural tail.
C: Metastases can occur in the brain, but they are less likely to present as a single, well-defined, extra-axial lesion with a dural tail.
D: Subdural hematomas are collections of blood between the dura and the arachnoid mater. They are typically crescent-shaped and do not enhance with contrast.
E: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain parenchyma. It would not typically present as an extra-axial lesion with a dural tail.
Given the information and the image, meningioma of the right frontal convexity is most probable diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description points to a lesion in the right frontal lobe (as indicated by right arm weakness and expressive aphasia which suggests involvement of Broca's area). The MRI findings indicate an extra-axial lesion with homogeneous contrast enhancement and dural tail, which is highly suggestive of a meningioma. The question states it is in the right frontal lobe, the answer options also state the area. The extra-axial location along with the dural tail signs and homogeneous contrast uptake strongly points towards a meningioma. Option A correctly identifies this as a meningioma and specifies the location as frontale sinistra, which does not match the clinical features (right arm weakness, speech difficulty), and it should be the right side. Because of the deficit stenico on the right side, we consider the correct answer to be frontale right. The question specifies frontale destro. Therefore the correct option is A, because all other answers would not be a meningioma. The description does not mention anything about a glioma, or metastasis.

Reasoning: The clinical presentation (19-year-old male with nocturnal thigh pain relieved by aspirin) and the radiographic findings (a small, well-defined sclerotic lesion with surrounding reactive bone formation, as seen in the images) are highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. The other options are less likely given the age, symptoms, and radiographic appearance. Chondroblastoma is more common in the epiphysis of long bones. Chondrosarcoma is more common in older individuals. Osteosarcoma is typically more aggressive and presents differently radiographically. Enchondroma is usually asymptomatic.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The clinical picture described - intense thigh pain, predominantly nocturnal, relieved by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) - is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. The other options are less likely given these specific characteristics. Osteosarcoma is a more aggressive cancer and less likely to respond to aspirin. Chondroblastoma typically affects the epiphysis of long bones. Chondrosarcoma and enchondroma are less likely to present with pain relieved by aspirin.",True

Reasoning: The image shows lesions that are most likely condyloma acuminata. Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod and surgical excision are appropriate treatments. Salicylic acid and corticosteroids would be inappropriate for this condition.",True,E,"IT0311, E
Reasoning: The question describes papules in the perineal region that are pink-brownish and sometimes coalesce into plaques, asymptomatic. This is likely Condylomata Acuminata or genital warts, given the clinical description. Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, surgery, and imiquimod are all standard treatments for genital warts. Salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used to treat genital warts and may even worsen the condition, particularly if misdiagnosed.",True

Reasoning: The chest x-ray shows a complete loss of lung markings in the left hemithorax with a visible visceral pleural line. This indicates a left pneumothorax, which can be life-threatening if tension develops. The trachea appears to be slightly deviated to the right as well, further supporting the diagnosis. The other options do not fit the radiographic findings. Cardiomegaly isn't indicated in this image. An hemothorax would show opacity rather than a complete absence of markings. Tracheal stenosis isn't a likely finding based on this x-ray. Aortic dissection wouldn't be visualized this way.",True,C,"IT0340, C

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense (bright) lesion along the inner surface of the skull. This shape is characteristic of a subdural hematoma. An acute subdural hematoma would appear hyperdense on a CT scan. Given the patient's history of a motorcycle accident and a GCS of 8/15, a traumatic brain injury is likely. The shape and location of the hematoma in the image strongly suggests a subdural hematoma. Epidural hematomas typically have a lenticular (lens-shaped) appearance. Intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal hematoma would have different appearances on the CT scan and are less likely given the crescent shape. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is an acute subdural hematoma.",True,B,"IT0375, B
Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdensity between the brain and the skull. This shape is characteristic of a subdural hematoma. Given the acute presentation following trauma and GCS of 8, an acute subdural hematoma is the most likely diagnosis.",True

Reasoning: A displaced fracture of the mid-shaft of the humerus is associated with injury to the radial nerve, because the nerve runs in the spiral groove on the posterior aspect of the humerus. Median and ulnar nerve injuries are not typically associated with fractures of the humerus. Thrombosis and embolization is more related to pelvic and lower limb fractures. Brachial artery injury is less frequent.",True,C,"IT0390, C

Reasoning: The ECG shows a rhythm with P waves preceding each QRS complex. However, there's a progressive prolongation of the PR interval followed by a blocked P wave (no QRS after the P wave). This pattern is characteristic of Mobitz type 1 second-degree AV block (Wenckebach phenomenon).
The other options are incorrect because:
A) Extrasistoles would appear as premature beats with abnormal morphology, which are not seen here. Furthermore, extrasystoles would be prematurely conducted instead of blocked.
C) Mobitz type 2 block would have a fixed PR interval before the dropped beat.
D) Advanced AV block would have a consistent relationship between P waves and QRS complexes, often with a higher degree of block.
E) Hemiblock would be characterized by changes in the QRS axis and morphology, not by blocked P waves.",True,B,"IT0455, B

Reasoning: The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, S1Q3T3 pattern and right heart strain (T wave inversions in V1-V3), which are classic signs of pulmonary embolism. Given the patient's risk factors (recent surgery, smoker, hypertension) and clinical presentation (sudden onset dyspnea, hypotension, hypoxemia), pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis. While cardiomiopathy can be considered in a hypertensive patient, the EKG doesn't show signs of ventricular hypertrophy. Anemization, Brugada syndrome and aortic dissection don't match the clinical picture or the EKG.",True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy and presents with acute dyspnea. His blood pressure is low (100/50 mmHg) and his oxygen saturation is 88%. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia with an S1Q3T3 pattern. This constellation of symptoms and ECG findings strongly suggests acute pulmonary embolism. A recent surgery is a risk factor for DVT/PE. Hypotension and hypoxia suggest a significant PE. The S1Q3T3 pattern, though not always present, is suggestive of PE. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism.
A is unlikely, no signs of Brugada syndrome.
C is unlikely as there is no mention of severe chest pain and the ECG is not typical for dissection.
D is possible, but the acute onset and recent surgery make PE more likely.
E is possible, but does not explain the acute dyspnea as well as PE.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): chest pain, diaphoresis, and neck constriction. He also has risk factors (hypertension and dyslipidemia). The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V6, indicating an anterior STEMI. In this situation, the priority is to perform emergency coronary angiography (<2 hours) to identify and treat the occluded coronary artery.

Reasoning: The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (chest pain, sweating, jugular vein distention) along with pre-existing hypertension and dyslipidemia which are risk factors. The ECG (which is blurry but we can still see ST elevations) suggests an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In the setting of STEMI, the immediate next step is emergency coronary angiography (within 2 hours) to identify and treat the culprit lesion via percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Reasoning: The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots and optic disc edema. This presentation is highly suggestive of a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The patient's age (75), hypertension, and cardiac issues are also risk factors for CRVO. While the patient may have diabetic retinopathy, the widespread nature of the hemorrhages and disc edema are more indicative of CRVO. Branch retinal vein occlusion would have a more limited area of involvement.

Central serous retinopathy would present with a serous detachment of the macula rather than widespread hemorrhages.",True,B,"IT0653, B
Reasoning: The patient is a 75-year-old with cardiovascular disease and hypertension who presents with sudden vision loss in the right eye (OD). The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, dilated and tortuous veins, and cotton wool spots, all suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). While branch retinal vein occlusion is possible, the widespread nature of the findings favors CRVO.

Reasoning: The patient presents with retrosternal discomfort and nausea, which are concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG shows ST-segment depression in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) and V1-V3, along with T wave inversion, which could indicate ischemia. Given the patient's history of diabetes, symptoms, and ECG findings, the most appropriate action is to admit the patient to a cardiac monitoring unit for serial ECGs and troponin measurements to assess for myocardial infarction. Further investigation is needed to rule out ACS. Coronary angiography might be required depending on the results of serial ECGs and troponin levels. Discharging the patient with aspirin and follow up would not be appropriate given the concerning ECG findings. Monitoring without admission, or pursuing non cardiac causes, would delay appropriate management of potential cardiac ischemia.",False,A,"IT0713, A
Reasoning: The patient is 50 years old, diabetic, presents with retrosternal discomfort and nausea, and has an abnormal ECG (though the specific abnormality cannot be determined from the provided empty image). Given these risk factors and symptoms, acute coronary syndrome is a strong possibility. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention is to admit the patient to a monitored cardiac bed to repeat the ECG and measure troponin levels to assess for myocardial damage. Options B, C, D, and E are not the best first step in this scenario. Starting aspirin and discharging (B) would be inappropriate without further investigation. Coronary angiography (C) might be necessary later, but not as the immediate first step. Monitoring in the ER (D) may delay necessary interventions if ACS is confirmed.

I genitori negano precedenti dolori o traumi alla  stessa spalla. La radiograﬁa è mostrata nella ﬁgura. Qual è la diagnosi più probabile fra  le seguenti?,A,True,D,"IT0784, D
Reasoning: The radiograph shows a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the proximal humerus. This is a common injury in children and adolescents, especially those involved in sports. The growth plate is the weakest part of the bone and is therefore more susceptible to injury. A traumatic event such as a fall or direct blow to the shoulder can cause the growth plate to separate. The radiograph shows widening of the growth plate, which confirms the diagnosis of a Salter-Harris type I fracture. The other options are less likely. A bone cyst is a benign tumor that usually does not cause pain unless it is large enough to fracture the bone. A clavicle fracture is typically located on the clavicle bone visible on the X-ray. Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that is rare in children. A chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage that is also rare in children. The presence of trauma during a soccer match, and the appearance of widening of the epiphyseal plate on the radiograph, point towards an epiphyseal injury.",False,D,"IT0784, D
Reasoning: The X-ray shows a clear separation at the proximal humerus growth plate (epiphysis). This, combined with the history of trauma in a 10-year-old, points towards a Salter-Harris type fracture, specifically a proximal humeral epiphyseal separation. The other options are less likely: bone cysts and sarcomas are usually not directly related to acute trauma, clavicle fractures are typically clinically evident, and chondrosarcomas are rare in children.",False

Reasoning: The patient presents with acute knee pain, swelling, a locking sensation, and limited range of motion (20-90 degrees) after a twisting injury. The arthroscopic image (Figure A) likely shows a displaced meniscal tear, and the MRI (Figure B) would confirm this. A ""bucket handle"" tear of the medial meniscus is a common cause of knee locking.

Reasoning: The image shows a characteristic ""bird's beak"" appearance at the lower esophageal sphincter, strongly suggestive of achalasia. The patient's symptoms of regurgitation, dysphagia, and chest pain are also consistent with achalasia. The negative endoscopy rules out neoplastic lesions. While hiatal hernia or GERD could cause some of the symptoms, the radiographic finding is most indicative of achalasia.

Nicolau syndrome is a localized skin reaction. AGEP presents with pustules, and Sezary syndrome is a T-cell lymphoma. Therefore, C is the most appropriate answer.",True,C,"IT0891, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with a maculopapular morbilliform eruption, facial edema, pruritus, and fever after starting allopurinol. The blood tests show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated transaminases, lipase, and amylase. These signs and symptoms are highly suggestive of Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, which can be triggered by allopurinol. The other options are less likely based on the information provided: SDRIFE does not usually present with systemic symptoms, Nicolau's dermatitis is related to drug injection, AGEP presents with pustules, and Sezary syndrome is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.",True
1,IT0892,Allo striscio di sangue periferico si osserva questa morfologia eritrocitaria con schistociti. Il quadro è indicativo di:,E,True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The peripheral blood smear shows fragmented red blood cells (schistocytes). This morphology is indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is a condition characterized by the fragmentation of red blood cells due to mechanical damage within the microvasculature. This can be caused by several conditions, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and HELLP syndrome.

The other options are incorrect because:
- Drepanocytosis presents with sickle cells, which are not present in the image.
- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia presents with spherocytes and other features that are not obviously present.
- Elliptocytosis presents with elliptocytes (oval shaped erythrocytes), not schistocytes.
- Macro-ovalocytosis is associated with megaloblastic anemia, and cells appear large and oval, which is not the dominant feature here.",True,E,"IT0892, E
Reasoning: The peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells). Schistocytes are characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), a condition caused by microvascular thrombi that shear red blood cells as they pass through. The prompt specifically asks about ""microangiopatia trombotica"" which translates to thrombotic microangiopathy, of which MAHA is a characteristic feature.",True
1,IT0908,Un paziente di 85 anni giunge all’ambulatorio di Endoscopia Digestiva per eseguire una esofagogastroduodenoscopia (EGDS) in seguito a riferita emissione di feci scure con riscontro agli esami ematochimici di anemia (Hb:8 g/dL) ipocromica microcitica. L’EGDS mostra in sede antrale il quadro riportato. Qual è la diagnosi endoscopica di quanto osservato?,A,True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and anemia, suggesting an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The EGDS shows a lesion in the antrum which is likely an ulcer. The image shows a flat spot with a clean base, which is most consistent with Forrest IIc. Forrest I would indicate active bleeding, and Forrest III a clean-based ulcer. A hyperplastic polyp would not typically cause this degree of bleeding. A diverticulum is also less likely than an ulcer in this clinical context.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with melena and anemia, suggesting a gastrointestinal bleed. The endoscopy reveals a lesion in the antrum. Based on the Forrest classification:
- Forrest I indicates active bleeding (spurting or oozing).
- Forrest IIa indicates a visible vessel.
- Forrest IIb indicates an adherent clot.
- Forrest IIc indicates a pigmented spot (flat, black spot).
- Forrest III indicates a clean base.

The question asks for the endoscopic diagnosis. Since the patient is 85 years old and the question is regarding the appearance of the antrum I am inclined to believe this is referring to an ulcer. The correct answer is A because this corresponds to the question, presenting an Ulcera gastrica antrale tipo Forrest IIc.",True
1,IT0919,"Un paziente di 56 anni si presenta in Pronto Soccorso con dolore diffuso in zona epigastrica. Appare ansioso, agitato, in cerca di una posizione per alleviare il dolore.

Alla luce del quadro clinico ed elettrocardiografico, quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",E,True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, bradycardia, extrasystoles, nausea, vomiting, leucocytosis, and hyperglycemia, which are all suggestive of a myocardial infarction. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, indicating an anterior STEMI. The ST-segment elevation is the key finding that distinguishes STEMI from NSTEMI. NSTEMI would involve troponin elevation without ST elevation on the ECG. Pericarditis may present with ST elevation, but it's typically diffuse and not as localized. A right bundle branch block is a conduction defect and would present differently on the ECG.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in multiple leads (likely inferior leads based on the image), which, along with the patient's clinical presentation (chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting), strongly suggests STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). The clinical picture of epigastric pain, anxiety, profuse sweating, and vomiting, coupled with the ECG findings, makes STEMI the most probable diagnosis. Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia are also commonly seen in acute myocardial infarction.",True
1,IT0949,"Una paziente di 56 anni è affetta da carcinoma squamocellulare della cervice uterina, inoperabile per estesa infiltrazione dei paramétri. Il trattamento programmato consiste in una chemioradioterapia.

Come si definisce quest’ultima tecnica di trattamento?",E,True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes a technique where an applicator containing Iridium-192 sources is placed within the vagina and uterus. This describes a type of brachytherapy. Looking at the options, the most appropriate term is ""brachiterapia intracavitaria"" which refers to the placement of radioactive sources within a body cavity. The image confirms this placement of the applicator. Interstitial brachytherapy involves placing the radioactive sources directly into the tissue. The other options are clearly not appropriate given the description.",True,E,"IT0949, E
Reasoning: The question describes the placement of an applicator containing Iridium-192 sources into the vagina and uterus. This is a form of brachytherapy where the radioactive source is placed within a body cavity. Therefore, the correct answer is intracavitary brachytherapy. Interstitial brachytherapy involves placing the sources directly into the tissue, not a cavity. External beam radiation is delivered from outside the body. Radioimmunotherapy involves the use of antibodies, and intraoperative radiotherapy is delivered during surgery.",True
1,IT0972,"Una donna di 32 anni, si reca in Pronto Soccorso per cardiopalmo. APR negativa. All’esame obiettivo: GCS 15/15, SpO2 99% in aria ambiente, FR 29 minuto, PA 110/65 mmHg, FC 180 bpm.

Alla luce del quadro ECG e dei parametri vitali quale tra i seguenti è l’intervento terapeutico più appropriato?",E,True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient is experiencing paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) due to nodal reentry, as evidenced by the ECG and rapid heart rate of 180 bpm. The patient is hemodynamically stable (PA 110/65 mmHg, SpO2 99%, GCS 15/15). Adenosine is the first-line treatment for PSVT, as it can transiently block the AV node, interrupting the re-entrant circuit and restoring normal sinus rhythm. Atropine and isoproterenol are not indicated for PSVT. Cardioversion is usually reserved for unstable patients. KCl is not related to the patient's condition.",True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), specifically a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia due to nodal reentry. The patient is hemodynamically stable (PA 110/65 mmHg, SpO2 99%), so the first-line treatment is adenosine. Adenosine is a rapid-acting AV nodal blocking agent that can terminate SVT. Atropine is used for bradycardia. Isoproterenol is a beta-adrenergic agonist used to increase heart rate and contractility, so it's contraindicated. KCl is potassium chloride used to treat hypokalemia. Cardioversion is indicated for unstable patients. Therefore, adenosine is the most appropriate initial treatment.",True
1,IT1022,"Un uomo di 73 anni, seguito per un pregresso melanoma del dorso, presenta ad un controllo programmato una neoformazione della regione sottoclavicolare destra, nettamente aumentata dall’ultimo controllo, di circa 3 cm di diametro, rilevata, di colore marrone chiaro, ruvida al tatto. Sono presenti altre neoformazioni simili, di diametro minore, sia a livello del torace che del collo. Alla dermatoscopia si apprezzano sbocchi follicolari simil-comedonici e pseudo-cisti cornee. Quale diagnosi suggeriscono la clinica e la dermatoscopia?",D,True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description of the lesions (raised, light brown, rough), the presence of multiple similar lesions on the chest and neck, and the dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudocysts are all characteristic of seborrheic keratosis. The patient's history of melanoma is relevant, but the clinical and dermatoscopic findings strongly favor seborrheic keratosis. Because the seborrheic keratosis is pigmented, pigmented seborrheic keratosis is most accurate.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description points to seborrheic keratosis. The key dermatoscopic features mentioned are ""follicular openings similar to comedones"" and ""horn pseudocysts,"" which are characteristic of seborrheic keratosis. The lesions being elevated, light brown, rough, and present in multiple locations on the trunk and neck further supports this diagnosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the dermatoscopic findings make melanoma less likely in this case.",True
1,IT1023,"Maschio di 40 anni, celiaco, si presenta all’osservazione con un’eruzione papulo-vescicolosa, simmetrica che si localizza preferenzialmente alle superfici estensorie degli arti. Il paziente riferisce intenso prurito e bruciore per il quale non ha trovato giovamento da una terapia con antistaminico per os prescritta dal Medico di Medicina Generale. Il segno di Nikolski è assente. Agli esami ematici si riscontrano anticorpi IgA anti-transglutaminasi epidermica (TG3) e anti-transglutaminasi tessutale a basso titolo. Viene eseguita una biopsia della cute che evidenzia uno scollamento dermo-epidermico alla microscopia ottica e, all’immunofluorescenza diretta, depositi granulari di IgA situati all'apice delle papille dermiche. Quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 40-year-old male with celiac disease presenting with symmetric papulo-vesicular eruptions on extensor surfaces of limbs, intense pruritus, and burning sensation unresponsive to antihistamines. The image shows such eruptions on the feet. The absence of Nikolski's sign rules out pemphigus vulgaris. Elevated IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase levels, along with dermo-epidermal separation and granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae on biopsy, strongly suggest Dermatitis Herpetiformis. Dermatosis a IgA lineare would show a linear pattern of IgA deposition at the dermo-epidermal junction, and pemphigoid bolloso di Lever is IgG mediated. Scabbia bollosa is less likely given the IgA deposits. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is Dermatitis Herpetiformis.",True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The description strongly suggests dermatitis herpetiformis. The patient is a 40-year-old male with celiac disease presenting with a symmetrical papulo-vesicular eruption on extensor surfaces, intense pruritus and burning, and no improvement with antihistamines. The absence of Nikolski's sign rules out pemphigus vulgaris. The key findings are the presence of IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies (specifically anti-epidermal transglutaminase TG3) and the direct immunofluorescence showing granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae. These are all characteristic findings of dermatitis herpetiformis. IgA linear dermatosis would show a linear deposition of IgA. Bullous scabies and bullous pemphigoid are also less likely due to the IgA deposits and the specific location.",True
1,IT1044,"Una signora di 67 anni con storia di dispnea da sforzo, mai indagata in precedenza e mai sottoposta ad intervento chirurgico toracico, esegue spirometria. Sulla base dei risultati di seguito riportati quale sindrome disventilatoria è più probabile tra le seguenti?",C,True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The spirometry results show that both FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) and FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) are reduced compared to the reference values. The FEV1/FVC ratio is 78%, which is within the normal range (65.9-89.5%). However, since both FVC and FEV1 are reduced, while the ratio is normal, this points toward a restrictive ventilatory defect. Furthermore, looking at the total lung capacity (TLC), the pre-bronchodilator value (2.89) is significantly below the reference range (5.5-7.8) confirming the restrictive pattern.
Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is a restrictive ventilatory defect. Option A is incorrect because the pulmonary volumes are decreased. Option B is incorrect because the pulmonary volumes are not increased. Option D is incorrect because there is no evidence of obstruction. Option E is incorrect because it refers to bronchial hyperreactivity, which is not the primary finding here.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The question describes a 67-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea who undergoes spirometry. We are asked to determine the most likely ventilatory defect based on the results (shown in the attached image).

Based on the spirometry results:
- FEV1 is reduced compared to the predicted value.
- FVC is reduced compared to the predicted value.
- FEV1/FVC is normal or increased.

These findings suggest a restrictive ventilatory defect. In restrictive lung diseases, both FEV1 and FVC are reduced, but the FEV1/FVC ratio is usually normal or increased because the decrease in FVC is proportionally greater than the decrease in FEV1.

Option A is incorrect because the volumes are not within normal limits.
Option B is incorrect because volumes are not increased.
Option D is incorrect as the normal FEV1/FVC excludes an obstructive pattern.
Option E is incorrect, as there's no mention of bronchoprovocation testing.",True
1,IT1053,"Una paziente di 68 anni, con storia di ipertensione arteriosa e ipercolesterolemia in buon compenso farmacologico con ACE inibitore e statina, riferisce da alcuni giorni debolezza, cefalea e vertigini. Viene eseguito un ECG il cui tracciato è riportato qui di seguito. Quale tra i seguenti è il trattamento più adeguato?",C,True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (AV block of the third degree) characterized by the absence of a relationship between the P waves and the QRS complexes. The P waves are present but do not conduct to the ventricles, which generate their own escape rhythm. Given the patient's symptoms (weakness, headache, and dizziness) and the complete heart block, the most appropriate treatment is a pacemaker implantation to restore a normal heart rate and improve cardiac output.
Cardioversion is for tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is for hypotension. Defibrillation is for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Stopping ACE inhibitor is not indicated by the ECG findings.",True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (3rd degree AV block), characterized by independent P waves and QRS complexes. This condition can cause weakness, headache, and dizziness due to reduced cardiac output. The most appropriate treatment for complete heart block is implantation of a pacemaker to restore a normal heart rhythm. Cardioversion is used for tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is used to treat orthostatic hypotension. ACE inhibitors are used for hypertension and should not be stopped in this setting. Defibrillation is used for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",True
1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between the exposure and the outcome. The formula for the odds ratio is (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of exposed cases (malati esposti), 'b' is the number of exposed controls (non malati esposti), 'c' is the number of unexposed cases (malati non esposti), and 'd' is the number of unexposed controls (non malati non esposti).

From the table:
- a = 250
- b = 150
- c = 100
- d = 400

Odds Ratio = (250*400) / (150*100)

Therefore, the correct calculation for the odds ratio is E.
Option D has the numerator and denominator swapped, making it incorrect.
Option A calculates Relative Risk incorrectly, as the numbers are not the total of exposed and non exposed, they are cases and controls.
Option B also calculates Relative Risk incorrectly using numbers from the table in a wrong formula.
Option C calculate the attributable risk using wrong numbers. Therefore it's incorrect as well.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between a disease and a risk factor in a case-control study. Case-control studies use the Odds Ratio to estimate the association. The Odds Ratio is calculated as (exposed cases * unexposed controls) / (unexposed cases * exposed controls). Based on the image (which contains the table), let's assume:
- Exposed cases = 150
- Unexposed cases = 250
- Exposed controls = 100
- Unexposed controls = 400

Therefore, Odds Ratio = (150 * 400) / (250 * 100), which corresponds to option E.",False

Reasoning: The CT scan shows filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, indicating pulmonary embolism. The chest X-ray shows non-specific changes but is compatible with pulmonary embolism, such as atelectasis, pleural effusion, or infiltrates. The patient also complains of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, symptoms consistent with pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain that worsens with breathing, which is suggestive of pleuritic chest pain. The CT scan with contrast (mdc) is particularly useful for detecting pulmonary embolism. Acute myocardial infarction (D) and acute myocarditis (A) are less likely to cause pleuritic pain. Pericardial effusion (C) can cause chest pain, but typically not related to breathing. Aortic dissection (E) can cause chest pain, but is more likely to be described as tearing or ripping. Given the clinical context and the use of CT angiography, pulmonary embolism is the most probable diagnosis.",False

Reasoning: The image shows a clear dissection flap within the ascending aorta, suggesting aortic dissection. The mediastinal window enhances the visualization of the aorta and surrounding structures, making the dissection more apparent. The other options do not correlate well with the image findings. Pulmonary embolism would primarily affect the pulmonary arteries, thymoma would be located in the anterior mediastinum, multiple pulmonary secondaries would appear as nodules in the lungs, and superior vena cava syndrome would present with enlargement of the superior vena cava.",False,E,"IT1114, E
Reasoning: The angioTC image described is mediastinal window and the symptoms are chest pain and dyspnea. The image is missing. Given the clinical context (chest pain, dyspnea) and the angioTC study, aortic dissection is the most probable diagnosis. The other options are less likely to present with acute chest pain and dyspnea.",False

Esegue TC Cranio senza mdc che evidenzia un ematoma subdurale destro. Quale dei seguenti aspetti di imaging è tipico dell’ematoma subdurale?,D,True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: A subdurale hematoma is typically crescent-shaped, conforming to the shape of the skull. This ""falce"" or sickle shape is characteristic. The image shows this crescent shape very well. A biconvex lens shape is more characteristic of an epidural hematoma.",True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning:
The question describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are typically crescent-shaped on imaging because they are not restricted by the periosteum at the sutures as is the case with epidural hematomas. The ""falx"" or ""a falce"" appearance reflects this crescent-like shape along the falx cerebri. Option B, ""aspetto a lente biconcava"" describes epidural hematoma.",True
