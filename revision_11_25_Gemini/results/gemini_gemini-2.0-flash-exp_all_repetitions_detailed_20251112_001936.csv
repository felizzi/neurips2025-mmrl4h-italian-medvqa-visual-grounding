Reasoning: There are ST elevations in leads V1-V4, which indicates an occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.",True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: While I don't have the image and can't provide a specific reason based on it, I can still use the text to try to infer the best answer. The question ""Il paziente presenterà probabilmente:"" translates to ""The patient will probably present:"".
A) Occlusione della circonflessa - Circumflex occlusion
B) Sintomi da attivazione vagale - Symptoms of vagal activation
C) Occlusione della discendente anteriore - Anterior descending occlusion
D) Occlusione della discendente posteriore - Posterior descending occlusion
E) Pneumotorace - Pneumothorax

Occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD) is the most common site of myocardial infarction. Without any other clinical context provided, it is the most probable presentation. Pneumothorax is less likely. Occlusion of the circumflex or posterior descending artery is possible but less frequent than LAD. Vagal activation symptoms are non-specific. Therefore, the most probable answer is C.",True

Reasoning: The patient is an 85-year-old with a history of stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy, presenting with urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear bullae and intense pruritus. The image shows tense bullae on an erythematous base. This clinical picture strongly suggests bullous pemphigoid, a common autoimmune blistering disease in the elderly.
Pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae that rupture easily, often with mucosal involvement. Herpes zoster presents with a dermatomal distribution of painful vesicles. Contact dermatitis usually presents with more localized eczematous changes. Impetigo bullosa is characterized by superficial, flaccid bullae caused by bacterial infection. Given the tense bullae and the patient's age and history, bullous pemphigoid is the most likely diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The description points towards bullous pemphigoid. An 85-year-old patient with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled blisters, and intense pruritus. These are all characteristic features of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease common in the elderly. The other options are less likely: pemphigus vulgaris typically presents with flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement, herpes zoster is usually unilateral and dermatomal, contact dermatitis is localized to the area of contact, and bullous impetigo is usually caused by bacterial infection and is more common in children.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae and intense pruritus. This clinical presentation is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. The image further confirms bullous lesions. Biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence is crucial for diagnosis. In bullous pemphigoid, linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone are typically observed. Option B covers these diagnostic measures including searching for antibodies anti-basement membrane. Option E mentions anti-desmoglein antibodies which are more specific to pemphigus. Option A is related to celiac disease and is not relevant here. Option C (dermatoscopy) is not a primary diagnostic tool here. Option D is Tzanck smear which is useful in viral infections, not bullous pemphigoid.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques and tense bullae, which are intensely pruritic. This presentation suggests a bullous dermatosis. To diagnose the specific type of bullous dermatosis, a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence is necessary. Direct immunofluorescence is crucial for identifying the specific antibodies deposited in the skin. Given the description, bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus are possible considerations. Option B includes the appropriate tests for bullous pemphigoid (anti-basement membrane antibodies). Option E is more directed towards pemphigus. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate initial diagnostic approach.",True
1,IT0053,"[In uno studio caso-controllo per comprendere l'eziologia del cancro dell'esofago, 870 casi e 902 controlli sono stati indagati per quanto concerne il consumo abituale di superalcolici.] L'associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio può essere quantificata calcolando:",C,True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question explicitly states that the study is a case-control study. In case-control studies, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between exposure and outcome because the incidence of the outcome is not measured directly. The formula for calculating the odds ratio is (a * d) / (b * c), where a is the number of exposed cases, b is the number of exposed controls, c is the number of unexposed cases, and d is the number of unexposed controls.

From the table in the image:
- a = 656 (Malati, Esposti)
- b = 516 (Non malati, Esposti)
- c = 214 (Malati, Non esposti)
- d = 386 (Non malati, Non esposti)

OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214).

Option C, OR: (656 · 386) / (516 · 214) is the correct formula for calculating the odds ratio in this case-control study. Therefore, C is the correct answer.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question describes a case-control study. In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between an exposure and an outcome. The odds ratio is calculated as (number of exposed cases * number of unexposed controls) / (number of unexposed cases * number of exposed controls). Based on the question and options, option C correctly provides the formula for calculating the odds ratio: OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). Options A, B, D and E are incorrect because they either calculate risk difference (RA) or relative risk (RR) which are not used in a case-control study, or they don't use the correct formula for odds ratio.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and quicker to conduct compared to cohort or intervention studies. They start with identifying cases (those with the disease) and controls (those without) and then look back to assess exposure to potential risk factors. Because they don't follow a population over time, they are not suitable for directly calculating incidence or prevalence. Therefore, option A is the most accurate. The image is not needed for the answer.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and can be completed in a shorter time frame compared to other study designs like cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. They are particularly useful for studying rare diseases or diseases with long latency periods. Incidence and prevalence calculations are typically associated with cohort or cross-sectional studies, not case-control studies. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.",True

Reasoning: The patient has epigastric pain and an ECG is done, which shows ST elevation in anterior leads, suggesting an acute anterior MI. Given the patient's low blood pressure (90/50 mmHg) and heart rate (57/min), nitroprussiate (A) or Diltiazem (B) would further worsen the hypotension. Enalapril (E) is contraindicated in acute setting. Warfarin (C) is contraindicated for acute MI. The most appropriate drug in this case is Ticagrelor (D).
The patient is also being prepped for the cath lab where they would receive definite treatment with primary PCI. It's important to start a dual antiplatelet therapy as quickly as possible and Ticagrelor is an appropriate loading dose.
However, Ticagrelor is also contra indicated as the ECG shows bradycardia.
According to AHA guidelines in acute setting for a patient with low blood pressure, Ticagrelor is relatively contraindicated so other options might be preferred unless the intervention has no other options.
Considering the above information, D should not be the right answer.
None of the option is 100% the ideal solution, but D is relatively better than the other alternatives.
The question askes ""While alerting the cath lab, it is appropriate to begin the administration of:"" indicating the patient needs the medication prior cath lab and for the emergency, so D will be the best option to pick.

But I'd prefer to contact the interventional cardiologist to ask if the patient can use the ticagrelor considering the bradycardia.
The low BP and the bradycardia associated with epigastric pain suggests this man may have an inferior infarct, with associated vagal response. If that is the case none of the options are correct.
I think more information is necessary to decide on which answer to choose.
Because the ECG does not show inferior or posterior ST elevation, it's a reasonable assumption to proceed with a Ticagrelor (D).
I might revise my response after the evaluation.
Although the patient has an anterior MI, Diltiazem is also not advised due to hypotension.
Enalapril is also not the best option in acute MI setting.
Nitroprussiate (A) is also not the best option since BP is low,
Thus, the best available option is Ticagrelor (D) in this setting.
I would give aspirin and Ticagrelor (D).
Other options are not correct.
After careful evaluation the best answer is D.
I changed my mind.
The question specifically states ""while alerting the cath lab,"" this indicates a need for prompt action to prepare the patient for potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor commonly used as part of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with acute coronary syndromes, including STEMI. This is appropriate in this setting.
Aspirin should also be used with ticagrelor.
The question does not mention aspirin use, so, I would answer as D.
However, the best option would be contacting the cardiologist to make the best decision.
Ticagrelor (D) would be the best answer.
However, if the ST segment is elevated with hypotension, use Heparin and consider an alternative medication rather than Ticagrelor.
I will choose D as a best answer available to me.
It's not correct answer, but best option to choose.
In acute MI cases, Ticagrelor should be given along with ASA.
It's best decision to contact the cardiologist to make the decision.
After careful assessment, ticagrelor is the best option to begin with, as it's an antiplatelet that can be started immediately while waiting for the cath lab. The other options are contraindicated or not indicated in this situation.
With the available options, ticagrelor is the most appropriate choice.
So, I will keep option D.
I revise all possible responses.
D is the best choice.

So my final answer:

IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, low blood pressure, low heart rate, and ECG findings suggestive of an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The question specifically asks about initiating treatment while alerting the cardiac catheterization lab, emphasizing the need for prompt action. Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor used as part of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in acute coronary syndromes.

Although the patient has bradycardia, which is a relative contraindication to ticagrelor, the need for prompt antiplatelet therapy in the setting of STEMI outweighs the risk. Other options are not appropriate because: Nitroprussiate (A) would further decrease blood pressure; Diltiazem (B) is contraindicated because of bradycardia; Warfarin (C) is not appropriate in the acute setting; Enalapril (E) is not used acutely in STEMI. Therefore, ticagrelor is the best available option while preparing for PCI.
Aspirin must be administered with ticagrelor as well in this case.
Because the question specifically askes to start the treatment while alerting the cath lab, quick action is necessary.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient is experiencing epigastric pain, is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg), bradycardic (57/min) and the ECG (not completely visible but likely indicates a myocardial infarction given the prompt to alert the hemodynamic lab). Considering this is likely a myocardial infarction, and given the need to alert the hemodynamic lab for possible intervention, an antiplatelet agent like Ticagrelor is indicated. Nitroprussiato is contraindicated due to the low blood pressure, Diltiazem should be avoided in bradycardia. Warfarin would not be a first line intervention. Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, should be withheld during the acute presentation given the low blood pressure.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows sinus bradycardia with a heart rate around 57 bpm, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), and ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicative of an inferior wall myocardial infarction. Given the inferior wall involvement, the most likely culprit artery is the right coronary artery (RCA).",True,A,"IT0065, A
Reasoning: The patient is a 48-year-old male with risk factors (smoker, hypertension on ACE inhibitor). He presents with epigastric pain of 6 hours duration. His vital signs show hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardia (57/min). Looking at the ECG (although the image quality is poor, we can still analyze it), we see ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF). This indicates an inferior myocardial infarction, which is typically caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). Therefore, the most likely location of the lesion is the right coronary artery.",True

Reasoning: The patient's neurological exam (unresponsive, withdrawal to pain, anisocoria) after a motor vehicle accident strongly suggests an acute intracranial injury. Anisocoria, in particular, raises concern for increased intracranial pressure and possible herniation. While subdural and epidural hematomas are possible, intraparenchymal hematomas are also very common in trauma, and the findings are consistent with that possibility. Chronic subdural hematomas are less likely given the acute presentation. Subgaleal hematomas are extracranial and would not explain the neurological findings. Among the options, intraparenchymal hematoma is a very plausible finding in CT scan.",False

Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 45-year-old patient with lower back pain unresponsive to anti-inflammatory drugs. An MRI of the lumbar spine reveals a likely bone metastasis. We are asked to identify the most appropriate next investigation to identify other bone metastases. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting bone metastases throughout the entire skeleton. Although CT of the whole spine can be performed, a bone scan is more sensitive and covers the whole body. A whole body CT scan with contrast is not routinely used for bone metastasis screening, as it provides more soft tissue detail than bone detail, and the contrast can add additional risk. An ultrasound scan would only be able to see metastases in superficial bones and thus is not a viable option. A low-dose CT scan of the whole skeleton will expose the patient to a lot of radiation and should only be considered as an option if a bone scan isn't available. Therefore, the best answer is a bone scan.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate test to identify the presence of bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy (scintigrafia ossea) is a highly sensitive method for detecting bone metastases, as it shows areas of increased bone turnover, which are often associated with metastatic lesions. While CT scans can also identify bone metastases, they are generally less sensitive than bone scintigraphy for detecting early or subtle lesions. Additionally, a whole-body bone scan provides a comprehensive assessment of the entire skeleton, making it more likely to detect multiple or unexpected metastatic sites. Ultrasound is not a suitable modality for screening for bone metastases.",True

La paziente si reca quindi dal neurologo che riscontra un deficit stenico all'arto superiore di destra e una afasia espressiva. Consiglia quindi l'esecuzione di una RM encefalo con mezzo di contrasto. Tale esame evidenzia la presenza di una lesione espansiva verosimilmente extra-assiale a livello frontale destro, captante vivacemente e omogeneamente contrasto, associata a ispessimento della dura madre perilesionale (tail durale) (si veda immagine).] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The clinical presentation (progressive weakness in the right arm and expressive aphasia) combined with the MRI findings (extra-axial lesion in the right frontal lobe, avid contrast enhancement, dural tail) strongly suggest a meningioma. The ""dural tail"" sign is highly characteristic of meningiomas. The lesion location correlates with the clinical symptoms.
Options B, C, D and E are less likely. Gliomas are typically intra-axial, metastases are typically multiple lesions. An acute subdural hematoma would have a different appearance on MRI, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage is inconsistent with dural tail. Additionally the progressive nature of the symptoms is also more indicative of a slow growing tumour, like a meningioma, rather than a sudden bleed. The location of the lesion (right frontal) in the image also rules out A.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description mentions a right frontal extra-axial lesion that enhances homogeneously with contrast and has a dural tail. The patient also has right upper limb weakness and expressive aphasia. This clinical and radiological picture is very suggestive of a meningioma. The symptoms (right arm weakness and expressive aphasia) correlate with the lesion location, which compresses the left motor cortex and Broca's area respectively.
Option B is less likely because gliomas are usually intra-axial.
Option C is possible, but the dural tail is more characteristic of meningiomas than metastases.
Option D is less likely given the gradual worsening of symptoms and contrast enhancement. Also an acute subdural hematoma is usually crescent-shaped on imaging.
Option E would present more acutely.
Since the tumor is extra-axial, and the symptoms are more likely due to compression of the LEFT motor cortex and LEFT Broca's area from a frontal lesion, therefore it should be A) Meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra. The wording in the Italian question is a bit ambiguous, and a lesion in the right frontal area can cause contralateral weakness.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense nocturnal thigh pain that responds to acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). This clinical presentation, coupled with the imaging showing a small, sclerotic lesion in the femur, is highly suggestive of an osteoid osteoma. The pain associated with osteoid osteomas is often relieved by NSAIDs like aspirin due to the production of prostaglandins by the tumor. The image clearly shows a nidus surrounded by sclerotic bone, a classic sign. The other options are less likely given the clinical and radiological findings. Condroblastoma is typically found in the epiphysis of long bones, condrosarcoma usually affects older patients, osteosarcoma presents with more aggressive features, and enchondroma is usually asymptomatic.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly nocturnal, that resolves with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin).

Reasoning: The image shows papules and plaques in the perineal region, which are likely condyloma acuminata (genital warts) caused by HPV. Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgical excision are all appropriate treatments for genital warts. Acido salicilico e corticosteroidi are not appropriate for condylomata. Salicylic acid may be used for other types of warts, but not condyloma. Corticosteroids would suppress the immune system and potentially worsen the condition.

Reasoning: The question describes papules in the perineal region that are pinkish-brown, sometimes coalescing into plaques, and asymptomatic. This clinical picture is strongly suggestive of Condylomata Acuminata, also known as genital warts. Therapies that are often used for condylomata acuminata are: Sinecatechins, Podophyllotoxin, surgical removal, and Imiquimod. Acido salicilico e corticosteroidi are not usually used for the treatment of Condylomata Acuminata and will not be effective in resolving the lesions.",True

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense collection along the inner surface of the skull, which compresses the brain. This is highly suggestive of an acute subdural hematoma. An epidural hematoma would typically appear lenticular (lens-shaped). The other options are not supported by the image.

The shape and location of the hematoma are key in identifying it as subdural.",True,B,"IT0375, B
Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdensity along the inner surface of the skull, which is characteristic of an acute subdural hematoma. The shape conforms to the brain's surface. The patient's GCS score of 8/15 is also consistent with a significant brain injury, such as a subdural hematoma. An epidural hematoma would typically be lens-shaped.

Reasoning: The question describes a displaced fracture of the midshaft humerus. The radial nerve travels in the spiral groove along the posterior aspect of the humerus. Therefore, it is at greatest risk of injury in this type of fracture. The other nerves listed (median, ulnar) are not in close proximity to the humerus and are less likely to be injured.

Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy and presents with dyspnea, hypotension (100/50 mmHg), and hypoxia (O2 saturation 88%). The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern. These findings are highly suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. The S1Q3T3 pattern is a classic but not always present sign of pulmonary embolism on ECG. Other options are less likely given the clinical picture and ECG findings. Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition that typically presents with a distinct ECG pattern and is less likely in this context. Aortic dissection is possible, but the ECG is less typical. Congestive heart failure is possible, but the ECG is not very supportive, and the acute onset makes PE more likely. Post-operative anemia is possible, but the acute onset of dyspnea and ECG findings make PE more likely. Also, the given ECG shows T wave inversion in leads III and V1-V3.",True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset dyspnea, hypotension (100/50 mmHg), and low oxygen saturation (88%). The patient is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy. These factors are all risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE). The ECG, while not clearly visible, is consistent with possible right heart strain patterns that are associated with PE. The sudden onset of dyspnea, hypotension, and hypoxemia in a post-operative patient are highly suggestive of PE. Other diagnoses are less likely given the clinical context. Syndrome di Brugada typically doesn't present with sudden dyspnea, and the ECG pattern isn't characteristic for it (although without a clearer image of the ECG, one can't rule out other possibilities). Aortic dissection typically presents with severe chest or back pain. While heart failure is possible, the acute onset and recent surgery point more towards PE. Anemia post-operatively can cause shortness of breath, but it wouldn't cause sudden onset and the low blood pressure is more indicative of another process.",True

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a fracture of the left femur. The fracture line is located in the intertrochanteric region. Therefore, it's a pertrochanteric fracture. The question asks for the definition of the type of fracture.
Option B, ""Frattura pertrocantericadel femore sinistro"" matches this description.
Other options are incorrect because they describe fracture locations different from the one shown in the image.
- A: ""Frattura sottocapitata"" (subcapital) would be located at the femoral head-neck junction.
- C: ""Frattura cervico-trocanterica"" (cervicotrochanteric) is not a standard classification.
- D: ""Frattura sottotrocanterica"" (subtrochanteric) would be located below the trochanters.
- E: ""Frattura trans-cervicale"" (transcervical) would be through the femoral neck.
The fracture is on the left femur.

Reasoning: The patient presents with neurological symptoms that have developed over several days, following a head trauma 4 weeks prior. The symptoms include difficulty walking, speech disturbances, and right-sided weakness. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense. This clinical picture, combined with the CT findings, is highly suggestive of a chronic subdural hematoma. The ""crescent"" shape is characteristic of subdural hematomas because they are located between the dura and arachnoid mater. The hematoma is also described as ""iso-hypodense"", meaning that it has a similar or slightly lower density than the brain parenchyma, which is characteristic of a hematoma that is several weeks old (chronic). An acute subdural hematoma would typically appear hyperdense (brighter) on CT. Intraparenchymal hemorrhages usually have a different appearance and clinical presentation. Subarachnoid hemorrhages are more diffuse. Epidural hematomas typically have a lens shape.",True,A,"IT0512, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech disturbances, right-sided weakness) and a history of head trauma 4 weeks prior. He is also on warfarin, which increases the risk of bleeding. The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense relative to the brain parenchyma. This appearance is classic for a chronic subdural hematoma. The crescent shape is due to the blood collecting between the dura and arachnoid membranes. The hematoma's iso-hypodensity suggests that it is not acute. An acute subdural hematoma would be hyperdense (brighter) on CT. Epidural hematomas typically have a lens shape. Intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages would have different appearances on CT and would not typically present with this gradual onset after a head injury.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a hyperlucent hemithorax with a visible visceral pleural line and absence of lung markings, consistent with a pneumothorax. The clinical presentation of sudden onset chest pain and dyspnea in a smoker is also highly suggestive of spontaneous pneumothorax. The shift of the mediastinum away from the affected side is a concerning sign, but the features are most characteristic of a pneumothorax.

Therefore, option D is the most appropriate next step.",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, and jugular constriction, which are classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Given his history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, ACS is highly suspected. The ECG is essential for determining the next step. After examining the ECG, there are ST elevations in multiple leads, indicating STEMI. In STEMI, the most appropriate treatment is emergent coronary angiography (within 2 hours) for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow. Troponin levels are useful, but a STEMI diagnosis can be made with the ECG alone, and time is of the essence. Inflammatory markers are not relevant in this context. Angio-CT is not the first-line treatment for a suspected STEMI. Coronary angiography within 24 hours is not fast enough.",True

Reasoning: The patient is a 75-year-old male with cardiac issues and hypertension presenting with sudden vision loss in OD (right eye). The fundus photograph shows widespread retinal hemorrhages, tortuous veins, and cotton wool spots radiating from the optic disc. This is highly suggestive of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Diabetic retinopathy would have other signs. Branch retinal vein occlusion would follow a particular branch rather than the entire retina. AMD would likely involve neovascularization and changes near the macula. Serous retinopathy wouldn't have hemorrhages of this magnitude.",True,B,"IT0653, B
Reasoning: The description is of a 75 year old hypertensive, with cardiac issues, and sudden loss of vision in the right eye. The image shows retinal hemorrhages, tortuous and dilated veins, and cotton wool spots. These findings are characteristic of a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Retinopathy due to diabetes causes similar findings, but the sudden vision loss is more suggestive of a CRVO in this hypertensive older man. Also, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy usually doesn't cause such sudden and marked vision loss. Retinal vein occlusion is strongly linked with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. A branch retinal vein occlusion would only affect one portion of the retina. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration usually causes chronic vision loss and does not usually present with widespread hemorrhages like this image shows. Central serous retinopathy is characterized by serous detachment, and the image is not consistent with that.",True

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a displacement of the proximal humeral epiphysis. The patient's age (10 years old) is consistent with the typical age range for epiphyseal fractures. The history of trauma supports the diagnosis. Options A, B, C, and E are less likely based on the X-ray appearance and the patient's clinical presentation. A fracture of the clavicle would be visible and easily identifiable. Ewing sarcoma usually presents with more aggressive bone destruction. A chondrosarcoma is less likely in this age group, although possible. An osseous cyst would be more lytic and in a different area. This image clearly shows a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the proximal humerus.",False,D,"IT0784, D
Reasoning: The radiograph shows a clear separation at the proximal humeral physis (growth plate). This, coupled with the history of trauma in a 10-year-old, strongly suggests a Salter-Harris type I fracture, which is a physeal separation, or an epiphyseal fracture, meaning a proximal humeral epiphyseal separation. This is best described by ""Distacco epifisario prossimale dell’omero"" which translates to proximal humeral epiphyseal separation. The other options are less likely given the trauma history and radiographic appearance: an isolated clavicle fracture would appear in a different location, a bone cyst is typically a more chronic condition with distinct radiographic features (not always trauma related), and sarcomas usually present with more aggressive bony changes and pain not specifically related to acute trauma, and chondrosarcoma is far less common in this age group and location.",False

Reasoning: The description of the patient's symptoms (acute knee pain, mild joint swelling, knee locking, limited range of motion) following a twisting injury after a jump is highly suggestive of a meniscal tear. The sensation of the knee blocking is very indicative of a bucket-handle tear. The arthroscopic image and MRI would likely confirm this. While ACL tear could also be possible, the ""locking"" symptom makes a meniscal tear more likely. The bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus fits perfectly with the ""locking"" symptom. Therefore, a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus is the most probable diagnosis.",True

Reasoning: The patient's symptoms (regurgitation, dysphagia) and the esophagography showing a dilated esophagus with a ""bird's beak"" narrowing at the lower esophageal sphincter point towards achalasia. While hiatal hernia and GERD can cause similar symptoms, the radiographic appearance is more consistent with achalasia. GIST and epiphrenic diverticulum are less likely given the progressive dysphagia and the overall radiographic appearance. The radiogram clearly shows significant esophageal dilation with a tapering at the gastroesophageal junction, highly suggestive of achalasia.",True,B,"IT0860, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with postprandial and nocturnal regurgitation, progressive dysphagia, and occasional chest pain with a negative cardiac evaluation. An esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy was negative for neoplastic lesions, and the esophagography is provided. The image shows a ""bird's beak"" appearance at the lower esophageal sphincter, which is characteristic of achalasia. Therefore, achalasia is the most likely diagnosis.
A) GIST of the gastric fundus typically does not cause dysphagia as the main symptom.
C) Hiatal hernia can cause reflux symptoms, but the dysphagia and esophagography findings are more indicative of achalasia.
D) GERD can cause regurgitation and chest pain, but not typically progressive dysphagia to this degree, and the esophagography would likely show esophagitis or strictures.
E) Epiphrenic diverticulum is less likely given the regurgitation and dysphagia symptoms; it often presents with dysphagia and regurgitation but the ""bird's beak"" appearance is not typical for this condition.",True

Reasoning: The question describes an 85-year-old patient presenting with melena and microcytic anemia, which prompts an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The EGD reveals a lesion in the antrum of the stomach. The image shows an ulcerated area with a clean base, which based on the arrows, appears to have a flat, non-bleeding base. Forrest IIc describes an ulcer with a flat spot in the base of the ulcer, which is indicative of recent bleeding that has now stopped. Forrest I would show active bleeding (spurting or oozing), and Forrest III would show a clean based ulcer without any signs of recent bleeding. A polyp would appear as a mass protruding into the lumen, and a diverticulum would appear as a pouch. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Ulcera gastrica antrale tipo Forrest IIc.",True,A,"IT0908, A
Reasoning: The question describes an 85-year-old patient with melena (dark stools), anemia, and the EGDS shows something in the antrum. The picture shows an ulcerated lesion with a black spot. The Forrest classification is used to describe the endoscopic appearance of ulcers. Forrest IIc refers to a flat spot on the ulcer base. Forrest I indicates active bleeding, while Forrest III indicates a clean ulcer base. Based on the picture, the best answer seems to be Forrest IIc since the ulcerated lesion has a black spot.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, and vomiting, concerning for acute coronary syndrome. The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V4, indicating a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The other options are less likely given the ECG findings.

An NSTEMI presents with elevated troponin but without ST elevation on the ECG. The ECG is not normal.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in multiple leads (V1-V6, I, aVL), indicating a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). The patient's symptoms (chest pain, sweating, nausea, vomiting) and the ECG findings strongly suggest a STEMI. Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia can also be associated with acute myocardial infarction. While NSTEMI is a possibility, the ST elevation on the ECG makes STEMI the more likely diagnosis. Pericarditis typically presents with diffuse ST elevation and PR depression, which is not the primary finding here. A right bundle branch block would show a different pattern on the ECG.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with signs of stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The ECG shows a narrow QRS complex tachycardia. The first-line treatment for stable SVT is vagal maneuvers, followed by adenosine. Cardioversion is reserved for unstable patients. Atropine and Isoproterenol are not indicated for SVT, and KCl is not relevant in this situation. Therefore, Adenosine is the most appropriate initial pharmacological intervention.",True,E,"IT0972, E
Reasoning: The patient presents with stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Adenosine is the first-line treatment for stable SVT due to its ability to transiently block the AV node and terminate the re-entry circuit. Cardioversion is indicated for unstable SVT. Atropine would be used for bradycardia. Isoproterenol increases heart rate, which is contraindicated here. KCl is used for hypokalemia.",True

Reasoning: The description mentions a rapidly growing lesion with features like comedo-like openings and pseudo-horn cysts under dermatoscopy. These findings are highly suggestive of pigmented seborrheic keratosis. The patient's age (73) and presence of multiple similar lesions also support this diagnosis. While melanoma is a consideration given the patient's history, the dermatoscopic findings are more characteristic of seborrheic keratosis.

Reasoning: The description of the lesion (increased in size, light brown, rough), along with the dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudo-horn cysts, strongly suggests seborrheic keratosis. The presence of multiple similar lesions further supports this diagnosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the described characteristics are not typical of melanoma. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma typically present differently. Dysplastic nevi are also different in clinical and dermatoscopic appearance.

Reasoning: The question describes a 40-year-old celiac man presenting with a symmetrical papulo-vesicular eruption on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, associated with intense pruritus and burning sensation. The patient is celiac. The Nikolski sign is absent. Blood tests show low titers of IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Skin biopsy shows dermo-epidermal detachment and, by direct immunofluorescence, granular IgA deposits at the apex of the dermal papillae. This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis. Dermatitis herpetiformis is strongly associated with celiac disease. The characteristic skin lesions are intensely itchy papules and vesicles, typically distributed symmetrically on the extensor surfaces of the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. The presence of granular IgA deposits at the dermal papillae is pathognomonic for dermatitis herpetiformis. The image confirms the presentation is similar to that described with dermatitis herpetiformis.

Reasoning: The patient has celiac disease and presents with symmetric papulo-vesicular lesions on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, intense pruritus, and burning sensation. The absence of Nikolski's sign and the presence of IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies (TG3 and tissue transglutaminase) at low titer in the blood, as well as dermo-epidermal detachment on skin biopsy and granular deposits of IgA at the apex of dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence, strongly suggest Dermatitis Herpetiformis.

1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between exposure and disease. The formula for the odds ratio is (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls), which translates to (a/c) / (b/d) or ad/bc where:
- a = number of cases with exposure
- b = number of controls with exposure
- c = number of cases without exposure
- d = number of controls without exposure

In this case:
- a = 250
- b = 150
- c = 100
- d = 400

Therefore, the OR = (250 * 400) / (150 * 100). The closest option to this is option E but has flipped terms, i.e., (150*400) / (250*100). I believe there's a mistake in the table. Considering this, OR should be (250 * 400) / (150 * 100), and the inverse OR should be (150*100) / (250*400). Option E corresponds to (150*400) / (250*100) which is incorrect if compared to the table. In the original formulation I made a mistake reading the table values.

Considering the actual data of the problem, corrected:
a = 150 (Exposed, not sick)
b = 250 (Exposed, sick)
c = 400 (Not exposed, not sick)
d = 100 (Not exposed, sick)
The formula should be (sick + exposed * not sick + not exposed) / (sick + not exposed * not sick + exposed). Hence, OR = (250*400) / (150*100). This can be rewritten as option E if we take the inverse. This is due to my initial assumption that a = Exposed and Sick. Thus, the solution would be to take the inverse, thus inverting the table labels.

Odds Ratio: (150*100) / (250*400)

Because the correct equation is the inverse of the provided equation, and the question is asking about the odds ratio for associating the disease with the risk factor, option E (150*400) / (250*100) is the closest approximation if the table's columns are switched (i.e., cases and controls).

Final Answer: The final answer is E
```",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between a disease and a risk factor in a case-control study. In a case-control study, we calculate the Odds Ratio (OR) to estimate the association. The OR is calculated as (a*d) / (b*c), where 'a' is the number of cases with the risk factor, 'b' is the number of cases without the risk factor, 'c' is the number of controls with the risk factor, and 'd' is the number of controls without the risk factor. From the table, a=150, b=250, c=100, and d=400. Therefore, the correct calculation is (150*400) / (250*100). Option E matches this formula.",False

Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain worsening with breathing, suggesting a pulmonary issue. The CT scan with contrast (mdc) is a key indicator, as it's often used to diagnose pulmonary embolism. While the images aren't crystal clear, the CT scan appears to show filling defects in the pulmonary arteries, which are characteristic of pulmonary embolism. Acute myocardial infarction and aortic dissection can also cause chest pain, but they typically present with different imaging findings. Pericardial effusion would present as a fluid accumulation around the heart on the CT. Given the clinical presentation and the nature of the imaging performed, acute pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The clinical presentation (dyspnea and chest pain worsening with breathing in a 73-year-old woman) and the imaging (TC torace con mdc) suggest pulmonary embolism. Although the image is not helpful due to low resolution, the clinical information points strongly towards pulmonary embolism as the most likely diagnosis.",False

Reasoning: The image shows a CT scan of the chest with contrast. There is a clear dissection of the aorta, visible as a separation of the aortic wall with contrast filling the false lumen. This is consistent with aortic dissection. The other options are less likely, as pulmonary embolism would primarily be seen in the pulmonary arteries, thymoma would be located in the anterior mediastinum, pulmonary metastases would appear as multiple nodules, and superior vena cava syndrome would involve the superior vena cava and surrounding structures.",False,E,"IT1114, E
Reasoning: The image shows a mediastinal window CT angiogram. The patient presents with chest pain and dyspnea. The most likely diagnosis among the options, considering the imaging findings typically visible in such a study, is aortic dissection, which would show a double lumen or flap within the aorta. The other options are less likely to be the primary finding on this type of scan given the patient's presentation.",False

Reasoning: The image shows a crescent-shaped hematoma along the right cerebral hemisphere, which is characteristic of a subdural hematoma. This shape is described as ""a falce"" (sickle-shaped or crescent-shaped) in the Italian answer options. A biconvex shape is more typical of an epidural hematoma. The image confirms the presence of a subdural hematoma.
The other options are not typical imaging findings for subdural hematomas: ""a sole radiante"" is associated with osteosarcoma, ""a sale e pepe"" can be associated with certain brain tumors, and ""a lente biconvessa"" is typically related to epidural hematomas.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.",True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: A subdural hematoma typically appears as a crescent-shaped collection of blood that conforms to the shape of the brain, often described as ""falce"" in Italian, meaning sickle or crescent shape. An epidural hematoma typically shows as a biconvex (lens) shape. The other options are not associated with subdural hematomas.",True
