1,IT0006,L'immagine mostra un tracciato elettrocardiografico corrispondente a:,C,True,B,"IT0006, B
Reasoning: The ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm, absent P waves, and fibrillatory waves (f waves), which are characteristic of atrial fibrillation. The QRS complexes are narrow, indicating that the ventricular conduction is normal. There are no ST segment elevations or depressions that would suggest an acute myocardial infarction. There is no evidence of a complete heart block as there are consistent QRS complexes following the fibrillatory waves.",False,D,"IT0006, D
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, which is indicative of an inferior wall myocardial infarction.",False
1,IT0007,Il paziente presenterà probabilmente:,C,True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: ST elevation is visible in leads V1-V4. This indicates an anterior wall myocardial infarction, and is highly suggestive of occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).",True,B,"IT0007, B
Reasoning: Without any clinical context or additional information from a related image, it's difficult to definitively determine the most likely presentation. However, ""Sintomi da attivazione vagale"" (Symptoms of vagal activation) is the most plausible answer given the lack of more specific details. Vagal activation can be triggered by various factors and result in a range of symptoms, including bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Other options point to specific medical events that would require more diagnostic data.",False

Le lesioni sono intensamente pruriginose.] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is elderly, diabetic, and on multiple medications. He presents with diffuse, intensely pruritic, urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear bullae. These findings are highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, especially considering the patient's age. Pemphigus vulgaris is less likely due to the tense bullae and lack of mucosal involvement described. Herpes zoster presents with dermatomal distribution. Contact dermatitis would likely have a clearer trigger, while impetigo bullosa usually presents with purulent content in the bullae. Therefore, bullous pemphigoid is the most probable diagnosis.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy. He presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear bullae that are intensely pruritic. This clinical picture is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, a common autoimmune blistering disease in the elderly. Pemphigus vulgaris typically involves mucosal involvement, which is not mentioned here. Herpes zoster presents with a dermatomal distribution. Contact dermatitis would likely be more localized and related to a specific allergen exposure. Bullous impetigo is more common in children and involves bacterial infection.",True

Le lesioni sono intensamente pruriginose.] Qual è il procedimento diagnostico più appropriato?",B,True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense bullae with clear content, suggesting a bullous dermatosis. Given the clinical presentation, the most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to investigate the basement membrane zone for antibodies. This can help differentiate between various bullous diseases such as bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis. Option A is related to celiac disease. Option C is not specific. Option D is for herpes infections (Tzank test). Option E is used for pemphigus. The image shows multiple tense bullae with some hemorrhagic changes, which are consistent with a bullous disease requiring biopsy and immunofluorescence to determine the specific etiology.

Final Answer: The final answer is B",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense bullae with clear content, and intense pruritus. This clinical presentation suggests a bullous disease. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to identify the site of blister formation and the specific antibodies involved. Searching for anti-basement membrane antibodies is crucial to differentiate between different bullous diseases, such as bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Options A, C, D and E are not the most appropriate initial diagnostic steps in this scenario. Specifically, option E focuses on anti-desmoglein 1 and 3, suggesting pemphigus, which is less likely given the urticarial plaques at onset.",True
1,IT0053,"[In uno studio caso-controllo per comprendere l'eziologia del cancro dell'esofago, 870 casi e 902 controlli sono stati indagati per quanto concerne il consumo abituale di superalcolici.] L'associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio può essere quantificata calcolando:",C,True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) is used to quantify the association between a disease and a risk factor. The formula for OR is (a*d)/(b*c), where:
- a = number of cases exposed to the risk factor
- b = number of cases not exposed to the risk factor
- c = number of controls exposed to the risk factor
- d = number of controls not exposed to the risk factor

From the table:
- a = 656 (Malati Esposti)
- b = 214 (Malati Non esposti)
- c = 516 (Non malati Esposti)
- d = 386 (Non malati Non esposti)

So, OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214)

Option C matches this calculation. Therefore, option C is correct.
Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect as they do not represent the correct formula or application of the odds ratio calculation for a case-control study. RR is used in cohort studies. RA also isn't the correct measurement. Option D also only calculates one part of the equation.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between a risk factor and a disease. The formula for the odds ratio is (cases with exposure * controls without exposure) / (cases without exposure * controls with exposure). Option C is the only option that uses the correct formula for an odds ratio.
To better clarify the meaning of the OR formula:
- 656 = cases with exposure (to superalcolici, assuming high alcohol consumption is the exposure)
- 386 = controls without exposure
- 516 = cases without exposure
- 214 = controls with exposure.
Thus, OR = (656 * 386) / (516 * 214)
RA (risk assessment) and RR (relative risk) are used more often in cohort studies instead.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and can be completed more quickly than cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. Incidence and prevalence cannot be calculated in case-control studies because the proportion of cases and controls is determined by the study design, not by the natural frequency of the disease in the population. The study starts with individuals already affected by the disease (cases) and a comparison group without the disease (controls).
The image supports the question, but it is not directly relevant to answering it. It is a table of data from the study, but we are asked about advantages of case-control studies in general.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and take less time to conduct compared to other study designs like cohort studies. This is because they start with individuals who already have the disease (cases) and compare them to a control group without the disease, making data collection more focused and efficient. Case-control studies are not suitable for directly calculating incidence or prevalence because they begin by selecting individuals based on their disease status.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, indicating an anterior STEMI. The patient also has hypotension and bradycardia, which could be due to the inferior or anterior MI.
Options A and C are not correct since no ST-segment elevation in lateral or inferior leads.
Option D is not correct, since we see elevated ST-segments (acute situation).

Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension, bradycardia, and an ECG that shows ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) and reciprocal changes. This presentation is consistent with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Given the ongoing ischemic event and the activation of the cath lab, the immediate treatment should focus on preventing further thrombus formation and stabilizing the patient. Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor, an antiplatelet drug, used to prevent further clot formation.
Nitroprussiato is contraindicated due to hypotension.
Diltiazem will slow down the heart rate, already low.
Warfarin is not used in an acute setting.
Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is not the first line treatment in an acute STEMI.
Therefore, ticagrelor is the most appropriate choice.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient is experiencing epigastric pain, is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg), and has a slow heart rate (57/min). The ECG is not provided, but the question states the hemodynamics lab is being alerted, suggesting a possible cardiac event like an acute coronary syndrome. In this scenario, antiplatelet therapy with Ticagrelor is appropriate while preparing for intervention. Nitroprussiato sodium would further decrease blood pressure which is not wanted in hypotensive patients. Diltiazem would reduce heart rate which is unwanted in bradycardic patients. Warfarin has a slower onset of action. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor, which the patient is already on, and would also worsen the hypotension. Ticagrelor would be suitable since antiplatelets are indicated in suspected ACS.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows sinus bradycardia (57 bpm) and ST segment elevation in inferior leads II, III, and aVF. This indicates an inferior wall myocardial infarction. Inferior wall MI is typically caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery. Hypotension could be explained by right ventricular infarction.",True,A,"IT0065, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and an ECG showing ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF). This constellation of findings, especially with the bradycardia, strongly suggests an inferior wall myocardial infarction, which is typically associated with occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA).",True
1,IT0095,"[Un ragazzo di 23 anni è vittima di un incidente automobilistico (moto contro auto). All'arrivo dei soccorsi viene riferito il seguente esame obiettivo neurologico: il paziente giace a occhi chiusi, non li apre né allo stimolo verbale né allo stimolo doloroso, eloquio assente, alla stimolazione algica il paziente tende ad allontanare gli arti dalla fonte dello stimolo. Presenta anisocoria per destra > sinistra.] Il paziente viene trasferito presso il Pronto Soccorso dove viene sottoposto a una TC cerebrale. Quale reperto è verosimilmente apprezzabile alla TC?",C,True,D,"IT0095, D
Reasoning: The patient has suffered a traumatic brain injury with a decreased level of consciousness (eyes closed, no response to verbal or painful stimuli, absent speech). He exhibits withdrawal movements to pain and anisocoria (unequal pupils, right > left). The image shows a hyperdense (bright) lesion with a crescent shape following the contour of the skull but limited by the sutures. This suggests an acute subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas typically occur after trauma, are often associated with impaired consciousness, and can cause pupillary abnormalities due to mass effect and herniation. The crescent shape is characteristic.
A) Intraparenchymal hematomas are located within the brain tissue itself.
B) Chronic subdural hematomas appear hypodense (darker) on CT and are slower to develop.
C) Epidural hematomas typically have a lenticular (lens-shaped) appearance.
E) Subgaleal hematomas are located outside the skull, underneath the scalp.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with signs of severe head trauma after a motor vehicle accident. The anisocoria (unequal pupil size, right > left) suggests a possible mass effect compressing the oculomotor nerve (CN III). While several types of hematomas are possible, an intraparenchymal hematoma (A) is the most likely diagnosis given the severity of the trauma and the neurological findings. A chronic subdural hematoma (B) is less likely given the acute nature of the injury. Epidural hematomas (C) are often associated with skull fractures and a lucid interval, which are not mentioned. Acute subdural hematomas (D) are possible but less likely than intraparenchymal, and subgaleal hematomas (E) are external to the skull and would not cause anisocoria. Therefore, A is the most probable finding on CT scan.",False

Reasoning: The image clearly shows a lateral view of the lumbar spine, with the vertebral bodies aligned vertically. This indicates that the image is taken in the sagittal plane. The plane appears to be aligned perfectly along the midline of the spine, so it is a pure sagittal plane.",True,A,"IT0130, A
Reasoning: The image shows a clear lateral view of the lumbar spine, demonstrating the vertebral bodies stacked one above the other. This represents a sagittal plane image. A ""pure"" sagittal plane means it is not angled or oblique.",True

Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question is asking which is the most appropriate exam to identify the presence of bone metastases after a lumbar spine MRI suggests a possible metastasis. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is a very sensitive test for detecting bone metastases, as it highlights areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic lesions. While a CT scan of the whole spine (TC del rachide in toto) or skeleton (TC dello scheletro in toto) can also identify bone metastases, the bone scan is generally considered the most sensitive initial imaging modality for detecting these lesions. Ultrasound (esame ecografico) is not the preferred modality for bone metastases detection. Low-dose CT might miss subtle lesions.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate investigation to identify the presence of bone metastases, given that an MRI has revealed a probable bone metastasis. A bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is a sensitive imaging technique that detects areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic disease. While CT scans can also detect metastases, a bone scan is generally more sensitive for detecting early or subtle metastases. Whole-body low-dose CT is a reasonable alternative, but the scintigraphy is the standard first choice. Ultrasound would not be helpful for deep bone structures. A CT of the whole spine is insufficient for a metastasis work-up.",True

Reasoning: The image shows villous atrophy of the intestinal mucosa. This is characterized by flattening of the villi, leading to a reduction in the absorptive surface area. The flattened appearance of the mucosa is consistent with atrophy. There are no signs of fistulas, abscesses, neoformation, bleeding or ulceration. The history of abdominal pain and postprandial diarrhea in the setting of suspected malabsorption further supports the diagnosis of villous atrophy. Therefore, the most accurate interpretation of the image is that there is atrophy of the mucosa.",True,B,"IT0136, B
Reasoning: The image shows a loss of villi and flattening of the mucosa, which is characteristic of mucosal atrophy. This is a common finding in malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease.",True

Le lesioni del tronco, di vecchia data, tendono anch'esse all'atrofia cicatriziale e a lasciare esiti iperpigmentari soprattutto periferici. Tutte le lesioni tendono al peggioramento dopo l'esposizione solare.] Qual è la terapia più indicata per questa paziente?",B,True,B,"IT0169, B
Reasoning: The patient's symptoms (erythematous-hyperkeratotic lesions, nummular shape, located on the scapular region, hyperkeratotic lesions with cicatricial alopecia on the scalp vertex, lesions tending to atrophic scarring and hyperpigmentation especially peripherally, and worsening after sun exposure) suggest a diagnosis of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE), specifically discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for CCLE/DLE. Other options are not as appropriate: nbUVB phototherapy can be used for some skin conditions, but it is not first-line for DLE and could potentially exacerbate the condition; topical calcipotriol is typically used for psoriasis; penicillin is an antibiotic and would not be appropriate for this condition; oral antifungals are used for fungal infections, which is not the likely diagnosis.",True,B,"IT0169, B
Reasoning: The description points towards Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE). The key features are:
- Erythematous, hyperkeratotic, nummular lesions on the scapular region.
- Hyperkeratotic lesions with cicatricial alopecia on the scalp.
- Lesions tending towards atrophic scarring and hyperpigmentation, especially peripherally.
- Worsening after sun exposure (photosensitivity).
Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for DLE. Other options like topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors are also used, but hydroxychloroquine is often preferred, particularly when lesions are widespread or refractory to topical treatment.

A) Phototherapy nbUVB is not indicated for DLE, as sun exposure worsens the condition.
C) Calcipotriol topico might help with the hyperkeratosis, but it will not address the underlying autoimmune process.
D) Penicillin is an antibiotic and has no role in DLE treatment.
E) Antimicotici orali are for fungal infections, which are not suggested by the description.",True

These findings are consistent with the damage to the small intestine caused by an immune reaction to gluten.",True,C,"IT0198, C
Reasoning: The histological findings of villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes are characteristic features of celiac disease. While non-celiac gluten sensitivity can cause similar symptoms, the histological changes in the small intestine are usually less severe. Crohn's disease typically involves patchy inflammation and granulomas, while Whipple's disease shows infiltration of the lamina propria with macrophages containing PAS-positive diastase-resistant material.

Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows multiple well-defined round opacities in both lungs. This pattern is highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases, especially considering the patient is undergoing pre-operative assessment for cholecystectomy, which could be related to an underlying malignancy. Miliary tuberculosis typically presents as smaller, more diffuse nodules. Pneumonia is less likely to be bilateral and round in appearance. Atelectasis usually presents as a lobar or segmental collapse. The location and shape of the opacities do not resemble ECG electrode shadows. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pulmonary metastases.",True,B,"IT0200, B
Reasoning: The image shows multiple, well-defined, rounded opacities throughout both lung fields, consistent with pulmonary metastases. The other options are less likely: miliary tuberculosis would present with smaller, more diffuse nodules; pneumonia typically shows consolidation; atelectasis usually presents as a more localized area of increased density; and ECG electrode shadows are not typically distributed so widely and regularly.",True

This is indicative of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, specifically Torsades de Pointes, given the twisting of the QRS complexes around the isoelectric line. The patient's loss of consciousness further supports this diagnosis.",True,E,"IT0213, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows a completely disorganized electrical activity with no discernible P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves. This is characteristic of ventricular fibrillation, which is a life-threatening arrhythmia. The clinical scenario of sudden loss of consciousness in a patient with chest pain further supports this diagnosis.",False

Reasoning: The patient lost consciousness abruptly after complaining about retrosternal pain which didn't improve. The ECG shows a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VF) that is causing the patient to be unresponsive. The most appropriate treatment is defibrillation as it is the first line treatment of VF. The remaining options are all less effective or not indicated.
- Lidocaine is a class IB antiarrhythmic and it can be used in stable VT but not when the patient is unstable.

Reasoning: The image shows signs of decomposition, including discoloration (livor mortis), bloating, and the presence of insect activity (maggots). Considering the complete resolution of rigor mortis, along with the other signs of decomposition, it suggests a post-mortem interval of approximately 3-5 days.

Option B is too short, given the extent of the decomposition.",True,A,"IT0229, A
Reasoning: The question describes a forensic scenario where a body is found in Sicily on August 13, 2011, at 8 PM. The description mentions that rigor mortis has completely resolved. Rigor mortis typically resolves within 36-72 hours (1.5-3 days). Since the question asks for a preliminary estimation and provides a wide range of options, 3-5 days is the most reasonable estimate from the provided choices. The other choices (less than 24 hours, about a year, about a month, about three months) are not consistent with a complete resolution of rigor mortis. The image is blank and therefore useless.",True

Si prende visione della TC encefalo senza mezzo di contrasto che nel frattempo è stata richiesta (si veda immagine).] Qual è la diagnosi più probabile?",C,True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis, with a history of hypertension and cirrhosis. The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left frontoparietal region, suggestive of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Given the clinical presentation and CT findings, the most likely diagnosis is spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal region. The left hemisphere controls motor function on the right side of the body, so a lesion there would result in right hemiparesis. The left hemisphere is also typically dominant for language. Therefore, damage to the left frontoparietal region can cause aphasia. The sudden onset also points towards a hemorrhagic event.

Option A is less likely because epidural hematomas are typically associated with trauma and often have a lens shape on CT, which is not evident here. Option B is less likely as well because acute subdural hematomas usually present with a crescent shape, not present here, and this patient's symptoms are more acute. Option D is possible, but the CT scan shows hyperdensity rather than hypodensity. Option E is possible, but this would usually have blood in the basal cisterns and in the subarachnoid space.

Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset of headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis. He has a history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis. The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left frontoparietal region. This presentation is consistent with a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Hypertension is a major risk factor for intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Given the clinical history and the CT findings, the most probable diagnosis is a spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal region.
A is incorrect because epidural hematomas typically present after trauma.
B is incorrect because the CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the frontoparietal region, not the parieto-occipital region, and acute subdural hematomas have a different appearance on CT.
D is incorrect because while ischemic strokes can cause similar symptoms, the CT scan shows a hyperdense area which is more indicative of a hemorrhage.
E is incorrect because subarachnoid hemorrhages typically present with a different pattern of bleeding on CT, and the location does not match the description.",True

Reasoning: The description indicates a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and speech difficulties (expressive aphasia). The MRI shows an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal region that enhances brightly and homogeneously with contrast, and dural tail. Meningiomas are extra-axial tumors that often enhance brightly and have a dural tail. The symptoms are referable to the compression in frontal right region, but because the weakness involves the arm contralateral (left) and the aphasia is likely caused by compression of Broca area (that is located in the left frontal lobe) the lesion is located on the right side. Therefore, meningioma of the frontal right convexity fits best. Gliomas are intra-axial. Metastases do not typically present with dural tail. Subdural hematomas and intraparenchymal hemorrhages have different imaging characteristics.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description indicates a lesion in the right frontal lobe causing left hemiparesis (weakness on the right arm) and expressive aphasia (difficulty with speech). The MRI reveals an extra-axial, contrast-enhancing lesion with a dural tail, suggestive of a meningioma. The location is described as ""frontale destro"" which is right frontal and therefore affects the left side. Option A is the closest because a meningioma of the left frontal convexity wouldn't explain the symptoms. However, there seems to be a mistake in the description which refers to ""frontale destro"" while the proposed solution talks about ""frontale sinistro"".
Since the symptoms are on the right side, the lesion should be on the left. A meningioma of the *right* frontal convexity is the only option consistent with an extra-axial lesion with dural tail. Although the language lateralization usually affects the left side, the weakness described is on the right side so a lesion on the left would affect this side. Option A is wrong, therefore.

Meningiomas are typically slow-growing and can present with progressive neurological deficits like weakness and speech difficulties. They are extra-axial (outside the brain tissue), enhance with contrast, and often show a dural tail sign on MRI. Gliomas (Option B) are typically intra-axial (within the brain tissue). Metastasis (Option C) is possible but less likely without a known primary cancer and the described features are more typical of meningioma. Subdural hematoma (Option D) would present more acutely. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (Option E) would be sudden onset. Based on all given information, meningioma remains the most probable diagnosis. A meningioma on the *right* frontal side is the best explanation. Option A is therefore the most appropriate answer.
So, although the text says ""frontale destro"", the only possible answer is A because it's the only one that describes meningioma.
Final Answer: The lesion is located on the left, thus explaining the symptoms.
I will ignore the fact that the text refers to ""frontale destro"".
A) is therefore the answer.
Final Answer: The description indicates a lesion in the frontal lobe causing right hemiparesis (weakness on the left arm) and expressive aphasia (difficulty with speech). The MRI reveals an extra-axial, contrast-enhancing lesion with a dural tail, suggestive of a meningioma. Option A is the correct answer.

Final Answer:

IT0236, A
Reasoning: The progressive weakness in the right arm and expressive aphasia point to a lesion in the left frontal lobe. The MRI findings of an extra-axial, contrast-enhancing lesion with a dural tail are highly suggestive of a meningioma. Option A is the most likely diagnosis, even if the description indicates that the lesion is on the right. Gliomas are intra-axial, metastasis less likely, subdural hematoma is acute, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage is sudden. The combination of the clinical presentation and MRI features points to a meningioma in the frontale sinistro.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense, primarily nocturnal thigh pain that is relieved by acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). The imaging shows a lesion consistent with osteoid osteoma, particularly the presence of a small, lucent nidus surrounded by dense sclerosis. Osteoid osteomas are known for causing pain that is often worse at night and is effectively relieved by NSAIDs like aspirin due to prostaglandin production within the nidus. The other options (chondroblastoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and enchondroma) are less likely given the clinical presentation and imaging findings. Chondroblastoma usually occurs in the epiphyses of long bones, chondrosarcoma is usually not relieved by aspirin, and osteosarcoma is more aggressive and not typically responsive to aspirin. Enchondromas are usually asymptomatic.",True,A,"IT0250, A

Sindrome di Brugada doesn't fit the ECG pattern. Aortic dissection typically presents with chest pain, not dyspnea, and the ECG doesn't support it. Post-operative anemia would not typically cause these ECG findings or the hypoxemia to this degree. Heart failure is less likely given the acute onset.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism.",True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with acute dyspnea, low blood pressure (100/50 mmHg), and low oxygen saturation (88%). He is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern (deep S wave in lead I, Q wave in lead III, and inverted T wave in lead III). This pattern, along with the patient's risk factors (age, hypertension, recent surgery), strongly suggests acute pulmonary embolism.

A) Brugada syndrome typically presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death, and the ECG shows a characteristic ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3. This is not consistent with the patient's presentation or ECG findings.
C) Aortic dissection typically presents with severe chest or back pain, and may cause a difference in blood pressure between the arms. The ECG may show non-specific ST-T wave changes. This is less likely given the ECG findings.
D) Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with heart failure typically develops over a longer period of time, and the ECG would likely show signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. The acute onset of dyspnea makes this less likely.

The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso-hypodense. These findings are highly suggestive of a chronic subdural hematoma. The hematoma being iso-hypodense implies that it is not a recent bleed. Acute subdural hematomas are typically hyperdense. Epidural hematomas are usually lenticular (lens-shaped) not crescent shaped.

Reasoning: In T1-weighted images (Image A), fluids like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) appear dark, while in T2-weighted images (Image B), fluids appear bright. Furthermore, if a contrast agent is administered, areas with increased vascularity or blood-brain barrier disruption will enhance (appear brighter) on T1-weighted images. Image A shows CSF dark, consistent with T1. Image B shows CSF bright, consistent with T2. Since the question mentions contrast agent, and image B does not appear to be a contrast enhanced sequence, the answer is likely that image A is T1 and image B is T2.
Considering option B and E:
Option B: Image A is T2 - Wrong. Image A is T1, Image B: T1 with contrast - Wrong. Image B is T2, not T1 with contrast.
Option E: Image A: T1 - Correct. Image B: T1 with contrast - Wrong. Image B is T2, not T1 with contrast.

Considering the image, Image A is likely T1, and we can exclude Image B to be a sequence with contrast based on the intensity of grey matter. Therefore it must be T2. So, the option that contains Image A = T1 and Image B = T2 is C.

The question ask the sequences of the two images. Image A is dark and Image B is bright, so the answer is C.

Here is the final rationale:
The first image shows CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) appearing dark, which is characteristic of a T1-weighted MRI sequence. The second image shows CSF appearing bright, which is characteristic of a T2-weighted MRI sequence. There's no obvious contrast enhancement in the image, therefore excluding ""with contrast"" option.
Therefore, Image A is T1-weighted and Image B is T2-weighted.

Final Answer: The final answer is C

Therefore, the next step is immediate coronary angiography (<2h) to identify and treat the culprit lesion with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, and jugular constriction, suggesting a potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG (though the image is blank/missing) is crucial to determine if there is ST-segment elevation. The patient is hypertensive and dyslipidemic, increasing the likelihood of coronary artery disease. If the ECG shows ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), immediate coronary angiography (<2 hours) is the gold standard treatment. If the ECG shows no ST elevation but other changes suggestive of ischemia (e.g., T-wave inversion, ST depression), urgent coronary angiography (<24 hours) would be considered, however, the clinical presentation is concerning and mandates rapid assessment. Considering the provided options, immediate coronary angiography is the most appropriate next step, presuming the ECG will show changes consistent with ischemia. If the ECG is normal or non-diagnostic, troponin levels would be the next step. Since it's missing, we must go by the text provided. Option A is not the first step, as coronary angiography is more invasive but faster and more specific. Option C is not indicated for acute coronary syndrome.

Reasoning: The patient presents with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) due to AV nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT). Although the patient is relatively stable (GCS 15/15, SpO2 99%, PA 110/65 mmHg), the heart rate is very high (180 bpm) and causing symptoms (cardiopalmo).

Reasoning: The patient is presenting with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) due to nodal reentry, as confirmed by the ECG. The patient is stable (GCS 15/15, SpO2 99%, PA 110/65 mmHg). In stable PSVT, the first-line treatment is vagal maneuvers, followed by adenosine if vagal maneuvers are unsuccessful. Adenosine works by slowing conduction through the AV node, which can terminate the reentrant circuit. Cardioversion is generally reserved for unstable patients (e.g., hypotension, altered mental status). Atropine would increase heart rate and is therefore contraindicated. Isoproterenol would also increase heart rate and is contraindicated. KCl is used for hypokalemia and is not relevant in this scenario.",True

Reasoning: The clinical presentation of multiple, elevated, light brown lesions, with a rough surface, along with the dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudocysts, strongly suggest pigmented seborrheic keratoses. The patient's age (73) also supports this diagnosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the described lesions do not typically align with melanoma morphology or dermatoscopic features. Other options such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma do not fit the description either. Dysplastic nevi typically show different dermatoscopic patterns.

Reasoning: The description points to seborrheic keratosis. The presence of multiple lesions, their location on the chest and neck, the light brown color, rough texture, and the dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and horn pseudocysts are all consistent with seborrheic keratosis.

The presence of IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies, particularly anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3), along with the characteristic IgA deposits at the dermal papillae seen on immunofluorescence, strongly suggests dermatitis herpetiformis. The image also shows papulo-vesicular lesions on the extensor surfaces, which aligns with the clinical presentation of dermatitis herpetiformis. While IgA linear dermatosis also involves IgA deposits, it often presents with a more linear pattern on immunofluorescence. Pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid would have different antibody profiles and immunofluorescence patterns, and scabies typically presents with burrows and excoriations. Bullous scabies is a rare variant and less likely in this scenario. Therefore, dermatitis herpetiformis is the most probable diagnosis.",True,A,"IT1023, A

Reasoning:
The spirometry results show a reduced FVC (57% of predicted) and FEV1 (60% of predicted), with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio (85%, where reference value is 65.9-89.5). This pattern suggests a restrictive ventilatory defect. In restrictive lung diseases, both FEV1 and FVC are reduced proportionally, leading to a normal or even increased FEV1/FVC ratio. In obstructive defects, the FEV1/FVC ratio is decreased. Options A and B are thus incorrect. There is no mention of a bronchodilator test to assess reversibility, making option D incorrect. Finally, option E is not directly reflected in the spirometry values, and is only indirectly deducible.",True,C,"IT1044, C

Viene eseguito un ECG il cui tracciato è riportato qui di seguito. Quale tra i seguenti è il trattamento più adeguato?",C,True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a very slow heart rate (bradycardia), likely caused by a high-degree AV block (possible third-degree AV block). The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness). The most appropriate treatment for symptomatic bradycardia due to AV block is permanent pacemaker implantation. Cardioversion is used for tachyarrhythmias, midodrine is for hypotension, stopping ACE inhibitors may be considered if there is hyperkalemia or symptomatic hypotension related to the drug, and defibrillation is used for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.",True,C,"IT1053, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (AV block III degree). Given the patient's symptoms (weakness, headache, dizziness), and the complete AV block, a pacemaker is the most appropriate treatment to restore adequate heart rate and improve symptoms. Cardioversion and defibrillation are not indicated for complete heart block. Midodrine is used to treat hypotension and is not indicated in this case. While ACE inhibitors can rarely cause hypotension, stopping it is unlikely to resolve a complete heart block.",True
1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of exposed cases, 'b' is the number of exposed controls, 'c' is the number of unexposed cases, and 'd' is the number of unexposed controls.
In this case:
a = 250
b = 150
c = 100
d = 400
So, the Odds Ratio = (250*400) / (150*100).
Option E correctly represents this calculation but is written in reverse order as (150*400) / (250*100). This is incorrect. Option D is also incorrect since is calculates it as (250*400)/(150*100) instead of (250*400)/(150*100).

Therefore, the correct calculation is Odds Ratio = (250 * 400) / (150 * 100), which is simplified to (250*400) / (150*100)
Option E: Odds Ratio: (150*400) / (250*100)
This is wrong. The correct answer should be:
Odds Ratio: (250*400) / (150*100)

However, based on the given data:
Exposed and Diseased (a) = 250
Exposed and Not Diseased (b) = 150
Not Exposed and Diseased (c) = 100
Not Exposed and Not Diseased (d) = 400

Odds Ratio = (a*d) / (b*c) = (250*400) / (150*100)

Since the table appears to have cases and controls reversed, let us assume malati is exposed and non malati is unexposed. Let's re-evaluate:
Exposed (malati) and Diseased = 250
Exposed (malati) and Not Diseased = 100
Unexposed (non malati) and Diseased = 150
Unexposed (non malati) and Not Diseased = 400

Odds Ratio = (250*400) / (100*150)
None of the options match this calculation.

Thus, my original reasoning is correct but the prompt is wrong:
Odds Ratio = (250*400) / (150*100) = 100000 / 15000 = 6.67
Rischio Relativo is for cohort studies not case-control, therefore options A and B are incorrect.
Rischio Attribuibile is option C: (250-100) / 900

The correct answer is E.

IT1100, E
Reasoning: The correct formula for Odds Ratio in a case-control study is (a*d)/(b*c), where:
- a = number of cases with exposure
- b = number of controls with exposure
- c = number of cases without exposure
- d = number of controls without exposure

From the table:
- Cases (Malati):
  - Exposed: 250
  - Not Exposed: 100
- Controls (Non Malati):
  - Exposed: 150
  - Not Exposed: 400

Therefore:
- a = 250
- b = 150
- c = 100
- d = 400

Odds Ratio = (250 * 400) / (150 * 100)
Option E presents the reversed values from the perspective of controls i.e. (150*400)/(250*100). But, using this formula it is the most suitable given the options. Note it must be a calculation of the type ""Odds Ratio"".
So, E is the only plausible answer.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between disease and risk factor in a case-control study. In case-control studies, we use the Odds Ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where:
- a = exposed cases
- b = exposed controls
- c = unexposed cases
- d = unexposed controls.
Based on the image (although the values are not very clear, they correspond to the question), if we assume:
- Exposed cases = 150
- Exposed controls = 250
- Unexposed cases = 400
- Unexposed controls = 100

Then the OR = (150*100)/(250*400) = (150*100)/(250*400) which is equal to E

The other options represent calculations of Relative Risk (which is used in cohort studies, not case-control) or Attributable Risk. Option D has the correct components for OR, but in the wrong arrangement.",False

Reasoning: The chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, and the CT scan shows an filling defect within the pulmonary artery, suggestive of a pulmonary embolism. The patient's symptoms (dyspnea and chest pain that worsens with breathing) are also consistent with pulmonary embolism. While other options could present with chest pain, the imaging evidence strongly points to pulmonary embolism. Myocardial infarction would typically have ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes, not necessarily specific findings on chest imaging. Acute myocarditis and pericardial effusion would have different imaging patterns, and aortic dissection would present with a different type of chest pain and imaging findings.",False,B,"IT1113, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain that worsens with breathing. The prompt states that the patient underwent chest X-ray and CT scan with contrast. The most likely diagnosis given these symptoms and the use of CT with contrast is pulmonary embolism. Myocarditis and acute myocardial infarction would likely have ECG changes, pericardial effusion is more likely to present with distant heart sounds, and aortic dissection would likely have more severe pain and widened mediastinum on imaging. Pulmonary embolism is often diagnosed with CT angiography.",False

Reasoning: The clinical presentation of chest pain and dyspnea, coupled with the mediastinal window of the CT angiogram, suggests a focus on vascular structures.
