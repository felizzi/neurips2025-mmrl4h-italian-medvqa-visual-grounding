1,IT0007,Il paziente presenterà probabilmente:,C,True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I and aVL. This indicates an anterior wall MI, which is most commonly caused by occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
Options A and D are incorrect because they refer to the circumflex and posterior descending arteries, respectively, which are not the primary blood supply for the anterior wall. Option B is incorrect because there is no evidence of vagal activation on the ECG. Option E is incorrect because the ECG findings are not consistent with a pneumothorax.",True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: The provided image is completely blank, providing no clues about the patient's condition or symptoms. Without any information to analyze, I cannot determine the likely presentation of the patient. However, since this is a multiple-choice question with a cardiovascular focus, and given the options, occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) is a common cause of significant cardiac events that a patient might present with. Therefore, I choose option C by default, but this is purely speculative due to the lack of information.",True
1,IT0031,"[Paziente uomo di 85 anni, pregresso ictus ischemico, diabetico, in terapia polifarmacologica.

Reasoning: The patient is elderly, has a history of ischemic stroke and diabetes, and is on multiple medications. The description mentions diffuse erythematous urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled blisters, which are intensely pruritic. This clinical presentation, along with the image showing tense blisters, is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is a common autoimmune blistering disease in elderly patients. Pemphigus vulgaris typically involves mucosal surfaces and flaccid bullae. Herpes zoster usually presents with a dermatomal distribution. Contact dermatitis would not typically present with tense bullae unless there is significant blistering. Bullous impetigo is more common in children and usually involves superficial blisters with a honey-colored crust.",True,A,"IT0031, A
Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy. He presents with diffuse erythematous urticarial plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled blisters that are intensely pruritic. These are classic symptoms of bullous pemphigoid, especially in this patient population. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that often presents with an urticarial phase before the development of bullae.
Pemfigo volgare is less likely as the bullae are typically flaccid and easily rupture. Herpes zoster typically presents as a dermatomal eruption of vesicles on an erythematous base and is painful, not just pruritic. Contact dermatitis is less likely to have such diffuse lesions, and impetigo bullosa presents with more superficial, less tense bullae and is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial plaques followed by tense blisters with clear content, which are intensely pruritic. Given the patient's age, medical history, and the clinical presentation, bullous pemphigoid is a strong possibility. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by autoantibodies against the basement membrane zone. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to detect these antibodies. While searching for anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 antibodies (option E) would be important for the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceus, the clinical presentation here is more suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. Tests for celiac disease (option A) are not indicated. Dermatoscopy (option C) and Tzanck smear (option D) are less specific and less useful in the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid compared to skin biopsy and immunofluorescence. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate diagnostic procedure.",True,B,"IT0032, B

Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by autoantibodies against the basement membrane zone. The appropriate diagnostic procedure would be a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to detect the presence of antibodies against the basement membrane. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate. Option E is less likely as it tests for antibodies related to pemphigus vulgaris/foliaceus, which presents with flaccid bullae and erosions. Option A is for celiac disease. Option C is not the primary diagnostic test for bullous disease. Option D is for viral infections.",True

Reasoning: Since it is a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association is the Odds Ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c) where a is the number of exposed cases, b is the number of exposed controls, c is the number of unexposed cases, and d is the number of unexposed controls.
From the table, a=656, b=516, c=214, and d=386. Therefore, OR = (656*386)/(516*214). Option C correctly reflects this calculation.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: The question describes a case-control study. In case-control studies, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between the exposure (habitual consumption of spirits) and the disease (esophageal cancer). The OR is calculated as (number of cases with exposure * number of controls without exposure) / (number of cases without exposure * number of controls with exposure). Option C represents the correct formula for calculating the odds ratio: (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). The other options present formulas for other measures that are not relevant for case-control studies (RA = risk difference, RR = relative risk). Also, the numbers 656, 214, 386, and 516 must correspond to the cells within the 2x2 contingency table.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are retrospective and relatively inexpensive and quick to perform compared to cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. They are useful for studying rare diseases or diseases with long latency periods. They do not allow for the direct calculation of incidence or prevalence because the researcher selects subjects based on their disease status. Instead, odds ratios are calculated to estimate the association between exposure and disease. The provided image doesn't influence this analysis, it just visualizes the structure of a case-control study with exposed/non-exposed individuals versus ill/non-ill individuals. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally known for their efficiency in terms of cost and time. They are retrospective in nature, starting with cases and controls and looking back to identify exposures. This makes them relatively cheaper and faster compared to cohort studies, which require following individuals over time to observe the development of disease. Case-control studies cannot be used to directly calculate incidence or prevalence because the proportion of cases and controls is determined by the study design, not by the natural occurrence of the disease in the population.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), suggesting an inferior STEMI. The patient is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardic (57/min). While awaiting transfer to the cath lab, the most appropriate initial treatment is an antiplatelet agent like ticagrelor (a P2Y12 inhibitor) to prevent further thrombus formation and promote reperfusion.

Nitroprussiato (A) is a vasodilator, which could worsen hypotension. Diltiazem (B) is a calcium channel blocker that can further decrease heart rate and blood pressure, which is not desirable in this case. Warfarin (C) is an anticoagulant and is not indicated for acute STEMI management. Enalapril (E) is an ACE inhibitor and while it is part of the long term management of patients with heart failure, it is not indicated as an acute intervention for STEMI, especially in a hypotensive patient.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and is a smoker with hypertension treated with an ACE inhibitor. The ECG (not well visualized but implied) and epigastric pain suggest a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Given the low blood pressure, nitroprussiate of sodium (A) is contraindicated, as it further reduces blood pressure. Diltiazem (B) is a calcium channel blocker and is not the first-line treatment for ACS, especially with bradycardia. Warfarin (C) is an anticoagulant, but not acutely indicated in this scenario. Enalapril (E) is an ACE inhibitor the patient is already on, and is therefore not an appropriate acute treatment. Ticagrelor (D) is a P2Y12 inhibitor and a crucial component of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in ACS. While waiting for hemodynamic intervention, initiation of Ticagrelor is appropriate.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) with reciprocal ST-segment depression in aVL. This points to an inferior wall myocardial infarction. Given the hypotension and bradycardia (PA 90/50 mmHg, FC 57/min), there is a high likelihood of involvement of the right ventricle. An occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) is the most common cause of inferior STEMI and RV infarction.",True,A,"IT0065, A
Reasoning: The patient is a 48-year-old male, smoker, hypertensive on ACE inhibitors, presenting with epigastric pain for 6 hours. He is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardic (57/min). The ECG (although a high-resolution image would be better) appears to show ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF). Inferior wall myocardial infarctions are commonly caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). Bradycardia is also common in inferior MI due to RCA supplying the SA node. Therefore, the most likely lesion is in the right coronary artery.",True

Quale reperto è verosimilmente apprezzabile alla TC?",C,True,D,"IT0095, D
Reasoning: The patient's symptoms (unresponsiveness to stimuli, anisocoria) after a motorcycle accident suggest a significant head injury. The CT scan shows a hyperdense (bright) crescent-shaped lesion that follows the contour of the skull but is limited by the dural reflections. This is a classic presentation of an acute subdural hematoma. An epidural hematoma typically has a lens shape. Intraparenchymal hematomas would be within the brain tissue itself. A subgaleal hematoma would be external to the skull. A chronic subdural hematoma would be hypodense (darker) on the CT scan.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with signs of severe head trauma following a motor vehicle accident. The anisocoria (unequal pupil size), along with the impaired level of consciousness and motor response to pain (withdrawal), suggests a potential space-occupying lesion causing increased intracranial pressure. Given the acute nature of the injury and the anisocoria, intraparenchymal hemorrhage is the most likely finding on a CT scan. An intraparenchymal hematoma can cause mass effect and herniation, leading to anisocoria due to compression of the oculomotor nerve. While other hematomas are possible, the acute presentation and neurologic exam make intraparenchymal hemorrhage the most probable. Subdural hematoma acute is also possible, but intraparenchymal hematoma corresponds more to an immediate response. Epidural hematomas are often associated with lucid intervals, which are not described here. Subdural hematoma chronic and subgaleal hematoma are less consistent with the acute presentation of head trauma with anisocoria.",False

Reasoning: The patient presents with shoulder pain after a fall on an outstretched hand with the shoulder slightly abducted and extended. This mechanism of injury is highly suggestive of an anterior shoulder dislocation (anterior glenohumeral dislocation). Anterior dislocation is the most common type of shoulder dislocation. The other options are less likely given the mechanism and presentation:
- Fracture of the greater tuberosity (trochite) is possible but less common with this mechanism.
- Acromioclavicular joint dislocation would likely have a different presentation.
- Glenoid cavity fracture is less likely.
- Posterior glenohumeral dislocation is less common and typically associated with seizures or electric shock.",True

Reasoning: The image shows a sagittal view of the lumbar spine. We can see the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other, the spinal cord running through the vertebral canal, and the intervertebral discs between the vertebrae. This is characteristic of a sagittal plane. Options D and E refer to oblique sagittal views for specific structures, but based on the overall image, a pure sagittal view is the most accurate description. Coronale or assiale is wrong because in that plane the spinal cord would not be seen as a vertical line in the middle of the image.",True,A,"IT0130, A

Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate investigation to identify bone metastases in a 45-year-old patient with low back pain and suspected bone metastasis on lumbar MRI.
A) Bone scintigraphy is a highly sensitive method for detecting bone metastases throughout the entire skeleton. It detects areas of increased bone turnover, which is common in metastases.
B) CT of the entire spine would only evaluate the spine and not the entire skeleton.
C) CT of the entire skeleton with contrast is an option, but bone scintigraphy is more sensitive for detecting early bone metastases. Also, the use of contrast is not essential for the detection of bone lesions in CT scans.
D) Selective ultrasound examination of suspected skeletal regions is inadequate for a complete assessment of the spread of potential metastases.
E) Low-dose CT of the entire skeleton exposes the patient to less radiation than a standard CT, but still has lower sensitivity for the detection of metastases than bone scintigraphy.

Therefore, bone scintigraphy is the most appropriate investigation to identify the presence of bone metastases.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 45-year-old patient with lower back pain unresponsive to anti-inflammatory drugs. An MRI reveals a possible bone metastasis. The question asks which investigation is most appropriate to identify the presence of bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy is a sensitive method for detecting bone metastases, as it detects increased bone turnover, which is often associated with metastatic disease. TC (CT scan) might show the lesions, but the scintigraphy is more sensitive in finding early metastases.",True

Reasoning: The image from the esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows a loss of villi, indicative of mucosal atrophy, which is characteristic of malabsorption. There are no signs of fistulas, abscesses, neoformations, bleeding, or ulcers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",True,B,"IT0136, B
Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old woman with postprandial abdominal pain and diarrhea undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for suspected malabsorption. The image shows a villous atrophy of the intestinal mucosa. The question asks what can be deduced from the image. The image shows a flattened mucosa with a lack of villi, indicating atrophy.

Reasoning: The patient presents with erythematous-hyperkeratotic, nummular lesions on the scapular region, hyperkeratotic lesions with cicatricial alopecia on the scalp vertex, and atrophic-cicatricial lesions on the trunk that worsen with sun exposure. This clinical picture is suggestive of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for DLE, as it helps reduce inflammation and disease activity. While phototherapy might be considered in some cases, it's generally avoided in photosensitive conditions like lupus without proper precautions. Calcipotriol is used for psoriasis.

Reasoning: The ECG shows a rapid, irregular rhythm with varying QRS morphologies. This is characteristic of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, specifically Torsades de Pointes. The QRS complexes twist around the isoelectric line, changing in amplitude and direction. This distinguishes it from monomorphic VT (C), which would have a consistent QRS morphology.

Reasoning: The image shows a cadaver with significant signs of decomposition, including skin discoloration (livor mortis) and the presence of insect activity (maggots). The complete resolution of rigor mortis, combined with these advanced decomposition changes, suggests that a significant amount of time has passed since death, but not excessively long (months or years).

Reasoning: The question describes a body found in a home in Sicily on August 13, 2011. The context indicates a legal investigation. The image (though white, we assume it shows a corpse) and description mentions the decomposition process having advanced to a point where there's a strong odor. Since rigor mortis has completely resolved, it means enough time has passed for decomposition to proceed. The question asks to estimate the time since death. Options C, D, and E (approximately a year, a month, and three months, respectively) seem excessive given that the officers had just found the body and an investigator arrived on the scene.

The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left fronto-parietal region, which is consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis further supports the diagnosis of spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The location of the hemorrhage in the left hemisphere explains the right hemiparesis and aphasia. The imaging does not show a lens-shaped hyperdensity indicating epidural hematoma nor crescent shaped indicating subdural hematoma, excluding choices A and B. A subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with a different pattern on CT and the image does not show that. The image also does not indicate ischemia.",True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache and vomiting, followed by aphasia and right hemiparesis. He has a history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis due to alcoholism. Examination reveals a soporific, aphasic and right hemiplegic patient. The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left frontoparietal region, consistent with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Given the history of hypertension and the CT findings, spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal region is the most likely diagnosis. The location of the lesion (left hemisphere) explains the right hemiplegia and aphasia.
An epidural hematoma is usually associated with trauma. A subdural hematoma might present with similar symptoms, but the CT scan appearance is different.

Reasoning: The description mentions a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and speech difficulties. The MRI shows an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal area with contrast enhancement and dural tail. This strongly suggests a meningioma. Since the patient has weakness in the RIGHT arm and speech issues (expressive aphasia), the lesion must be in the RIGHT frontal area. Therefore, option A (Meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra) is not the right answer. Looking at the picture, the location is in the RIGHT frontal area. Gliomas (B) are generally intra-axial, not extra-axial. Metastasis (C) is possible, but less likely to have dural tail and homogeneous contrast enhancement. Hematoma (D) is less likely since the symptoms developed over MONTHS, not acutely. Hemorrhage (E) is typically acute, and the lesion would not show contrast enhancement in the same way. Therefore, a meningioma in the right frontal convexity is the most probable diagnosis, because this correlates with the image showing a RIGHT FRONTAL lesion. The option is 'Meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra', therefore the right option is A, as in the original text it is written that the symptoms are in the right part of the body (therefore affected LEFT hemisphere).
The image is RIGHT FRONTAL, but the symptoms match LEFT hemisphere damage. I apologize for the error.
So the correct choice is A.
IT0236, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and speech difficulties. The MRI reveals an extra-axial lesion in the RIGHT frontal area with vivid and homogeneous contrast enhancement, along with thickening of the adjacent dura (dural tail). The key findings are:

1.  **Extra-axial lesion:** This indicates a lesion outside the brain parenchyma, narrowing down the possibilities. Gliomas are intra-axial.
2.  **Right frontal location:** The image clearly shows a right frontal lesion. Right frontal corresponds to LEFT hemisphere.
3.  **Contrast enhancement:** The lesion enhances with contrast.
4.  **Dural tail:** This is a classic sign of meningioma.

Considering these points:

*   Meningiomas are extra-axial tumors that often attach to the dura and exhibit a dural tail sign. They also typically enhance with contrast. Since the weakness is in the right arm and the speech is affected, the lesion should be in the LEFT frontal region. The image shows the lesion in the RIGHT frontal region. Therefore, the correct answer must match the symptoms. The speech area that controls speech is in the LEFT hemisphere.

*   Gliomas are intra-axial and typically don't have a dural tail.

*   Metastases can occur, but the dural tail is less common.

*   Subdural hematomas are typically acute, and spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage wouldn't typically present with these MRI features.

Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is A) Meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra.",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive right arm weakness and expressive aphasia. The MRI reveals a contrast-enhancing, extra-axial lesion in the right frontal region with dural tail. This clinical and radiological picture is highly suggestive of a meningioma. Meningiomas are typically extra-axial, slow-growing tumors that arise from the meninges. They often enhance with contrast and may have a dural tail sign, where the dura mater adjacent to the tumor thickens. The patient's symptoms correlate with the lesion's location. The other options are less likely because gliomas are intra-axial, metastases are usually multiple, subdural hematomas are typically associated with trauma, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage would not present with this imaging. While the description specifies the lesion is in the right frontal lobe, the patient presents with aphasia which correlates with lesions on the dominant side which is likely the left side in a right-handed person. The weakness is also on the right which would correspond to the contralateral (left) side of the brain where the issue is. Option A says meningioma of the left frontal convexity.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male presenting with intense thigh pain, predominantly nocturnal, relieved by acetylsalicylic acid. The images show a lesion with surrounding sclerosis, typical for osteoid osteoma. The clinical presentation of nocturnal pain relieved by aspirin is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. Therefore, A is the most likely answer.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The question describes a 19-year-old male with intense thigh pain, predominantly nocturnal, that resolves with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). This clinical picture is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. Aspirin relieves pain because osteoid osteomas produce prostaglandins. The image supports this choice, as it is consistent with an osteoid osteoma lesion. While a definitive diagnosis would require imaging, the clinical presentation is classic for this condition.",True

Reasoning: The question describes papules and plaques in the perineal region, likely Condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgical removal are all treatment options for genital warts. Topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not indicated, as corticosteroids can suppress the immune system and potentially worsen the condition. Also, the image supports the diagnosis of condylomata acuminata. Therefore, the non-indicated therapy is the one with salicylic acid and corticosteroids.",True,E,"IT0311, E
Reasoning: The question describes a patient presenting with pinkish-brown papules in the perineal region, sometimes coalescing into plaques. This presentation suggests condylomata acuminata (genital warts) or possibly other benign lesions. Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, surgical excision, and imiquimod are all treatment options for genital warts. Topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used to treat this type of lesion and may even worsen it by suppressing the immune response.

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense collection between the brain and the skull. This shape is typical of a subdural hematoma. The patient's GCS score of 8/15 suggests significant neurological impairment, which is consistent with a subdural hematoma causing mass effect. An epidural hematoma typically has a lens shape, not a crescent shape. While the image quality is limited, the shape and location strongly suggest a subdural hematoma. The other options (intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraparenchymal hematoma) are less likely given the appearance on the CT scan. An acute subdural hematoma is typically hyperdense on CT scans.",True,B,"IT0375, B

Reasoning: The question describes a displaced fracture of the mid-shaft of the humerus. The radial nerve runs in the spiral groove on the posterior aspect of the humerus, making it vulnerable to injury in this type of fracture. The other structures listed are less likely to be injured in this specific fracture location. Median and ulnar nerve injuries are more common with fractures around the elbow. Brachial artery injury is possible, but less common than radial nerve injury.

Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset dyspnea, hypotension (100/50 mmHg), and hypoxemia (SpO2 88%). He has a history of hypertension and smoking, and recently underwent prostatectomy. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, and right bundle branch block (RBBB). The most likely diagnosis considering these factors is acute pulmonary embolism. A saddle embolus would obstruct the pulmonary artery, leading to right heart strain, hypotension, hypoxemia and dyspnea. The recent surgery is also a significant risk factor for venous thromboembolism and therefore pulmonary embolism. RBBB is consistent with right heart strain, which can occur due to acute pulmonary hypertension from the PE. Brugada syndrome is unlikely given the absence of ST segment elevation in V1-V3. Aortic dissection is not consistent with the ECG. The patient is hypotensive, which would be less consistent with hypertensive cardiomyopathy. Anemia is less likely given the rapid onset of symptoms.",True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy and presents with dyspnea. His blood pressure is low (100/50 mmHg) and his oxygen saturation is 88%. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern. These findings are suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. The risk factors include recent surgery, hypertension, and age. The S1Q3T3 pattern on the ECG is a classic, although not always present, sign of pulmonary embolism.
A is unlikely as there are no typical ECG findings of Brugada syndrome. C is less likely as the ECG does not show signs of ischemia or strain usually seen in aortic dissection. The blood pressure is low rather than typically high in aortic dissection. D is possible, but the acute onset and recent surgery point more towards pulmonary embolism. Anemia is unlikely to cause dyspnea to this degree so soon after surgery.",True

Reasoning: The patient's history includes a fall 4 weeks prior, followed by progressive neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech disturbances, right-sided weakness). The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hematoma that is iso- to hypodense compared to the brain parenchyma. This is characteristic of a chronic subdural hematoma. The hematoma's shape follows the contour of the brain. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage would appear as a more localized area within the brain tissue itself.

Reasoning: The patient's history includes a fall with head trauma 4 weeks prior, gradual onset of neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech disturbances, right-sided weakness), and the presence of a crescent-shaped hematoma on CT scan that is iso- to hypodense compared to the brain parenchyma. This constellation of findings is highly suggestive of a chronic subdural hematoma. Chronic subdural hematomas typically develop over weeks after a head injury, may present with fluctuating or insidious neurological symptoms, and appear as crescent-shaped collections of blood on CT scans. The density of the hematoma changes over time; in the chronic phase (weeks after the injury), it can be iso- or hypodense compared to the brain tissue. The other options are less likely: an acute subdural hematoma would typically occur within hours or days of a head injury, and appear hyperdense on CT. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage would have different clinical presentations and CT scan appearances.

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the proximal humerus. This is a separation of the epiphysis from the metaphysis. The patient is 10 years old, which is an age where this type of injury is common due to the growth plate being weaker than the surrounding bone. The history of trauma to the right shoulder during a soccer game supports the diagnosis of an epiphyseal separation. There is widening of the growth plate.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
A) Cisti ossea giovanile: While a bone cyst can occur in the proximal humerus, the radiograph does not show a typical cystic lesion.
B) Frattura della clavicola: The radiograph does not show any fracture of the clavicle.
C) Sarcoma di Ewing: This is a malignant bone tumor, and the radiograph does not show the typical features of Ewing's sarcoma, such as a destructive lesion with periosteal reaction.
E) Condrosarcoma: This is a malignant cartilage tumor, which is less common in the shoulder region. The radiograph does not show the typical features of chondrosarcoma, such as chondroid matrix calcification.",False,D,"IT0784, D
Reasoning: The radiograph shows a fracture through the proximal humeral physis. The patient is a 10 year old child, with a history of trauma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is proximal humeral epiphyseal separation (Salter-Harris type I fracture).
The other options are less likely, given the age of the patient, the acute presentation after trauma, and the radiographic appearance. A bone cyst, Ewing's sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are less likely because they usually present with insidious onset of pain and may not have a traumatic event preceding their diagnosis. A clavicle fracture would be visible at the clavicle and not proximal humerus.",False

A GIST would likely present as a mass on endoscopy. Hiatal hernias can cause reflux, but the esophageal dilation and tapering are more indicative of achalasia. While GERD can cause similar symptoms, the esophagram findings are not typical of GERD. An epiphrenic diverticulum would appear as an outpouching on the esophagram, which is not present here.
Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is achalasia.",True,B,"IT0860, B

Reasoning: The description of diffuse pruritus worse at night, papules and excoriations, and linear lesions (burrows) with a papule at the end are all highly suggestive of scabies. The image confirms the presence of these burrows on the hand. While pediculosis can also cause pruritus, the absence of head involvement and the presence of burrows make scabies the more likely diagnosis.

Reasoning: The description points towards scabies. The diffuse itching (excluding the head), worse at night, presence of papules and excoriations due to scratching, and specifically the linear lesions (burrows) with a papule at the end on the side of the finger strongly suggest scabies. Pediculosis affects mainly the head, body, or pubic region. Urticaria presents with wheals, not linear lesions. Bullous pemphigoid causes large blisters.

Reasoning: The patient presents with a morbilliform eruption, facial edema, intense pruritus, and fever after starting allopurinol. Blood tests show hypereosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and elevated liver enzymes, lipase, and amylase. This constellation of symptoms strongly suggests Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome.

Reasoning: The question describes a peripheral blood smear showing schistocytes. Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells, and their presence is a hallmark of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is a condition where small blood vessels are damaged, leading to red blood cell fragmentation as they pass through. The term ""microangiopatia trombotica"" (thrombotic microangiopathy) encompasses diseases such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which are characterized by MAHA. The other options are less likely to present with significant schistocytes.

Reasoning: The patient presents with typical symptoms of a myocardial infarction (chest pain, anxiety, sweating, nausea, vomiting). The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V4, indicating an anterior STEMI. The ST elevation is significant and consistent with acute myocardial injury. Leucocytosis and hyperglycemia are also common in acute MI. While awaiting the specific enzyme results (troponin), the ECG findings are strongly suggestive of a STEMI. Pericarditis can be ruled out because there are no widespread ST elevations or PR depressions, and block of the right bundle branch can be ruled out because there are no typical signs of RBBB. The ECG is clearly not normal. In the absence of ST elevation, NSTEMI would be the next possible cause but in this case it is present.",True,E,"IT0919, E
Reasoning: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, indicating a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction).

Reasoning: The description of the lesion being ""nettamente aumentata dall’ultimo controllo"" (markedly increased since last checkup), its color being light brown, rough to the touch, and the presence of other similar lesions on the chest and neck, combined with dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like follicular openings and pseudo-horn cysts, strongly suggests pigmented seborrheic keratosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the clinical and dermatoscopic features are more consistent with seborrheic keratosis. The rapid growth makes it less likely to be a dysplastic nevus. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma do not typically present with these dermatoscopic features. The image confirms the clinical findings and further supports the diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis, specifically the dermatoscopic features.",True,D,"IT1022, D
Reasoning: The description of the lesions (increased size, light brown color, rough texture, multiple similar formations), along with the dermatoscopic findings of ""follicular openings similar to comedones"" and ""horn pseudo-cysts,"" strongly suggests pigmented seborrheic keratosis. Although the patient has a history of melanoma, the current lesions' characteristics are more indicative of seborrheic keratosis. The rapid growth might raise suspicion, but seborrheic keratoses can sometimes exhibit rapid growth. Basal cell carcinoma typically presents with different features (pearly appearance, telangiectasia), as does squamous cell carcinoma (ulceration, crusting).

Il segno di Nikolski è assente. Agli esami ematici si riscontrano anticorpi IgA anti-transglutaminasi epidermica (TG3) e anti-transglutaminasi tessutale a basso titolo. Viene eseguita una biopsia della cute che evidenzia uno scollamento dermo-epidermico alla microscopia ottica e, all’immunofluorescenza diretta, depositi granulari di IgA situati all'apice delle papille dermiche. Quale tra le seguenti è la diagnosi più probabile?",A,True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The patient is a 40-year-old male with celiac disease presenting with a symmetric, papulo-vesicular eruption, predominantly on extensor surfaces of the limbs, intense pruritus and burning sensation, no response to antihistamines, negative Nikolski sign, low-titer IgA anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3) and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, dermo-epidermal cleavage on skin biopsy, and granular IgA deposits at the tips of dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence. These findings are characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis. The strong association with celiac disease and the specific IgA deposition pattern on immunofluorescence are particularly important for this diagnosis.
- IgA linear bullous dermatosis typically shows linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane.
- Pemphigus vulgaris typically has IgG antibodies against desmoglein 3 and/or desmoglein 1. The Nikolski sign is usually positive.
- Bullous scabies would be rare and would be characterised by burrows.
- Bullous pemphigoid is characterised by IgG antibodies against BP180 and BP230, and linear IgG deposition along the basement membrane.
The image supports the description of papulo-vesicular eruptions.",True,A,"IT1023, A
Reasoning: The key clues in the question point towards Dermatitis Herpetiformis. These include:
1. Celiac disease: Dermatitis Herpetiformis is strongly associated with celiac disease.
2. Papulo-vesicular eruption: The description of the rash as papulo-vesicular is characteristic.
3. Symmetrical distribution on extensor surfaces: This is a classic distribution pattern for Dermatitis Herpetiformis.
4. Intense pruritus and burning: The patient reports intense itching and burning.
5. IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies: The presence of IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies, especially anti-epidermal transglutaminase (TG3), supports the diagnosis.
6. Biopsy findings: The granular IgA deposits at the tips of the dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence are highly characteristic of Dermatitis Herpetiformis.

Based on this information, Dermatitis Herpetiformis is the most likely diagnosis.
The other options are less likely:
- Dermatosi a IgA lineare: While IgA is involved, the deposition pattern is different. IgA lineare shows linear deposition along the basement membrane.
- Pemfigo volgare: This is an autoimmune blistering disease that involves IgG autoantibodies. The Nikolsky sign is positive.
- Scabbia bollosa: Scabies is characterized by intense itching, but the rash is different.
- Pemfigoide bolloso di Lever: This is an autoimmune blistering disease with IgG autoantibodies targeting the basement membrane. It does not typically involve granular IgA deposits at the dermal papillae.",True

Reasoning: The spirometry results show a reduced FVC (57% of predicted) and FEV1 (60% of predicted). The FEV1/FVC ratio is 78%, which is within the normal range (65.9-89.5%). The TLC is significantly reduced as well (43% of predicted). A restrictive ventilatory defect is characterized by reduced lung volumes, specifically FVC and TLC, while the FEV1/FVC ratio remains normal or even elevated. An obstructive defect is characterized by a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a restrictive ventilatory defect.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: Based on the spirometry results, the FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced, and both FEV1 and FVC are below 80% of the predicted values. This pattern is suggestive of a restrictive ventilatory defect. An obstructive pattern typically shows a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio with a normal or near-normal FVC. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a restrictive ventilatory syndrome.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (AV block of the third degree). The P waves are present but are not related to the QRS complexes. The QRS complexes are broad and slow, indicating a ventricular escape rhythm. The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, and dizziness) due to the slow heart rate.

Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (third-degree AV block), characterized by P waves and QRS complexes that are completely dissociated. The patient is symptomatic (weakness, headache, dizziness). The most appropriate treatment for symptomatic complete heart block is implantation of a pacemaker. Cardioversion and defibrillation are not appropriate, midodrine is for hypotension, and stopping ACE inhibitors would not address the AV block.",True

Reasoning: The question refers to a case-control study, in which Odds Ratio is the appropriate measure to quantify the association between disease and risk factor. Odds Ratio is calculated as (exposed with disease * unexposed without disease) / (exposed without disease * unexposed with disease). From the table, this is (250 * 400) / (150 * 100), which is equal to option E. The provided formula in option D is inverted. Relative risk is not used in case-control studies. Attributable risk is not calculated this way.",False,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the correct measure of association is the Odds Ratio. From the image, we can infer the following table:
- Cases with risk factor: 150
- Cases without risk factor: 250
- Controls with risk factor: 400
- Controls without risk factor: 100

The Odds Ratio is calculated as (Cases with risk factor * Controls without risk factor) / (Cases without risk factor * Controls with risk factor), which is (150 * 100) / (250 * 400) = (150*100)/(250*400).

However, the available options do not match this result exactly. The provided options are slightly different, so we will consider them separately:

A) Rischio Relativo: (150/400) / (250/100) - incorrect as it attempts to calculate relative risk in a case-control study, which is not appropriate.
B) Rischio Relativo: (150*250) / (100*400) - incorrect as it attempts to calculate relative risk in a case-control study, which is not appropriate.
C) Rischio Attribuibile: (250-100) / 900 - incorrect as it calculates attributable risk, which is irrelevant to measuring association in a case-control study.
D) Odds Ratio: (250*400) / (150*100) - incorrect as it inverts the correct Odds Ratio formula.
E) Odds Ratio: (150*400) / (250*100) - The question asks ""Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?"" This is asking for odds ratio. Cases are people WITH the disease, and controls are people WITHOUT the disease. Using the values in the provided image, Odds Ratio = (people WITH disease WITH risk factor * people WITHOUT disease WITHOUT risk factor) / (people WITH disease WITHOUT risk factor * people WITHOUT disease WITH risk factor). OR = (150*100) / (250*400). Because the image shows that the numbers were reversed on the diagram for risk factor and no risk factor, option E is the correct calculation: (150*400) / (250*100).",False

Reasoning: The image shows a CT scan with contrast of the thorax, mediastinal window. The aorta appears to have a dissection flap. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection.",False,E,"IT1114, E
Reasoning: The image shows a mediastinal window CT scan of the chest. Given the patient's symptoms (chest pain and dyspnea) and the possible diagnoses, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection. The mediastinal window is used to visualize the aorta and other mediastinal structures. Aortic dissection can be seen as a double lumen or a flap within the aorta. Although the image quality is low, it is most likely aortic dissection, rather than the other options. Pulmonary embolism would be better assessed with pulmonary angiography and not with the mediastinal window.

Reasoning: The question describes a subdural hematoma (SDH). SDHs typically appear as crescent-shaped (or ""falx""-shaped) collections of blood that follow the contour of the brain. Option A describes the appearance of meningiomas; B and E describes epidural hematoma; option C describes the aspect of parkinsonism. The image shows a subdural hematoma.",True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: A subdural hematoma typically appears as a crescent-shaped collection of blood that follows the contour of the brain, often described as ""a falce"" in Italian (sickle-shaped or crescent-shaped). This shape is due to the hematoma being located between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater, allowing it to spread along the dural surface. An epidural hematoma, in contrast, typically has a biconvex or lens shape because it is limited by the sutures of the skull.",True
