Reasoning: The ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with absent P waves and fibrillatory waves, consistent with atrial fibrillation. The QRS complexes are narrow, indicating that the ventricular conduction is normal. There is no ST-segment elevation or depression to suggest myocardial infarction. The PR interval cannot be assessed due to the absence of P waves, therefore it's not possible to diagnose AV block based on this ECG alone.",False,B,"IT0006, B

Therefore, the patient will likely present with occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.",True,C,"IT0007, C
Reasoning: The provided image is completely blank. Therefore, without any information, I can only guess.

Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke and diabetes, on polypharmacy. He presents with diffuse urticarial erythematous plaques with subsequent appearance of tense, clear fluid-filled bullae. The lesions are intensely pruritic. These clinical features, especially the tense bullae and intense pruritus, strongly suggest bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is more common in elderly individuals. The other options are less likely: pemphigus vulgaris typically has flaccid bullae and mucosal involvement; herpes zoster presents with a dermatomal distribution; contact dermatitis is related to exposure and rarely has bullae so prominent; bullous impetigo is more common in children and is caused by bacterial infection.

Reasoning: The patient is an elderly man with a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and polypharmacy. He presents with urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear-filled bullae that are intensely pruritic. This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of bullous pemphigoid.

*   Bullous pemphigoid typically affects elderly individuals and presents with tense bullae on an erythematous or urticarial base. The lesions are often intensely pruritic.
*   Pemphigus vulgaris is less likely because it typically presents with flaccid bullae and erosions, often involving mucosal surfaces.
*   Herpes zoster presents with a dermatomal distribution of painful vesicles.
*   Contact dermatitis usually has a more localized distribution and is often associated with a known allergen or irritant.
*   Bullous impetigo is more common in children and presents with superficial bullae caused by bacterial infection.",True

Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense, clear fluid-filled bullae with intense pruritus. This presentation is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure is a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence, searching for anti-basement membrane antibodies. While options A and E involve antibody testing, they target different diseases (celiac disease, pemphigus vulgaris, respectively). Tzank smear is more useful for viral infections like herpes. Dermatoscopy is not the primary diagnostic tool for bullous diseases. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate. The presence of tense bullae warrants investigation for bullous pemphigoid or other blistering diseases, and the image confirms the presence of tense bullae. Direct immunofluorescence helps to identify the specific location and type of antibody deposition at the basement membrane zone, which is crucial for diagnosis.",True,B,"IT0032, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with urticarial erythematous plaques followed by tense bullae with clear content, and intense itching. This clinical picture suggests a bullous disease. The most appropriate diagnostic procedure would be a skin biopsy for histology and direct immunofluorescence to identify the specific antibodies involved and the level of blister formation. Searching for anti-basement membrane antibodies is important because bullous pemphigoid is a likely diagnosis given the age and history. The other options are less specific and would not provide as much diagnostic information. Option A relates to celiac disease. Option C (dermatoscopy) might be useful to view the morphology of the bulla, but it will not give a definite diagnosis. Option D (Tzank smear) is more useful for diagnosing viral infections like herpes. Option E addresses pemphigus vulgaris or foliaceus, which is less likely with the initial urticarial plaques.",True
1,IT0053,"[In uno studio caso-controllo per comprendere l'eziologia del cancro dell'esofago, 870 casi e 902 controlli sono stati indagati per quanto concerne il consumo abituale di superalcolici.] L'associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio può essere quantificata calcolando:",C,True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: Since this is a case-control study, the appropriate measure of association is the odds ratio (OR). The OR is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where a = number of exposed cases, b = number of exposed controls, c = number of unexposed cases, and d = number of unexposed controls. In this case, a = 656, b = 516, c = 214, and d = 386. Therefore, the OR is (656 * 386) / (516 * 214). Option C correctly represents this calculation.",True,C,"IT0053, C
Reasoning: In a case-control study, the odds ratio (OR) is used to estimate the association between an exposure (in this case, alcohol consumption) and a disease (esophageal cancer). The OR is calculated as (odds of exposure among cases) / (odds of exposure among controls), which is equivalent to (a/c) / (b/d) or (a*d) / (b*c), where 'a' is the number of cases exposed, 'b' is the number of controls exposed, 'c' is the number of cases unexposed, and 'd' is the number of controls unexposed.
Given that the question is asking to quantify the association using the data collected from the case-control study, the odds ratio is the appropriate measure. The numbers 656 and 214 are likely the number of cases and controls exposed to the factor respectively. Therefore, 386 (902-516) is the number of controls NOT exposed. Also, 516 (870-656) is the number of cases NOT exposed to the factor. Therefore, the OR formula becomes: (656 * 386) / (516 * 214).

RA is Risk difference, which is appropriate for cohort studies, RR is relative risk, which is also used primarily in cohort studies, not case-control studies.",True

Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally less expensive and quicker to conduct than cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. This is because they start with existing cases of the disease and controls, rather than following a population over time to observe the development of the disease. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because case-control studies do not directly measure incidence or prevalence. They are retrospective and look back to determine exposures. They can, however, estimate the odds ratio, which approximates the relative risk when the disease is rare.",True,A,"IT0054, A
Reasoning: Case-control studies are generally quicker and less expensive than cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. They are particularly useful for studying rare diseases or those with long latency periods. Calculating incidence or prevalence is generally not possible in case-control studies, as they start with existing cases and controls rather than a defined population at risk.",True

Reasoning: The ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1-V4, indicating an anterior STEMI. The patient's symptoms (epigastric pain), risk factors (smoking, hypertension), and vital signs (hypotension, bradycardia) are consistent with this diagnosis. There's no significant ST elevation in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) to suggest inferior STEMI. No reciprocal ST depression is apparent, making pericarditis less likely. There are no clear Q waves to suggest a previous infarction, although an old ECG would be beneficial to confirm. The ST elevation is localized to the anterior leads, so it's less likely to be an anterolateral STEMI. Hence, the best answer is STEMI anteriore, which means Anterior STEMI.",False,E,"IT0063, E
Reasoning: The ECG (although low quality) appears to show ST elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V4). This indicates an anterior STEMI. The patient's symptoms (epigastric pain), risk factors (smoker, hypertension), and vital signs (hypotension) are also consistent with acute myocardial infarction. While an anterolateral STEMI could be possible, the ST elevation appears most prominent in the anterior leads. Pericarditis typically shows diffuse ST elevation. The absence of Q waves makes an old anterior infarct less likely. An inferior STEMI would show ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF).",False

Reasoning: The patient is hypotensive (90/50 mmHg) and bradycardic (57/min) with epigastric pain, suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, indicating an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Given the hypotension and bradycardia, options like nitroprussiate and diltiazem are contraindicated. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor and should not be given in the acute setting. Ticagrelor is an antiplatelet agent that is indicated in ACS, therefore the answer is Ticagrelor.",True,D,"IT0064, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with epigastric pain, hypotension (90/50 mmHg), bradycardia (57/min), and the ECG (not viewable) likely shows an indication for urgent cardiac intervention. Given the potential for acute coronary syndrome, specifically an inferior STEMI in the context of epigastric pain, hypotension, and bradycardia, the most appropriate immediate action, while awaiting cardiac catheterization, is to administer an antiplatelet agent such as ticagrelor. Nitroprussiate is contraindicated in hypotensive situations. Diltiazem may further lower the heart rate and blood pressure, potentially worsening the patient's condition. Warfarin would not be appropriate in this acute setting. Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is contraindicated in hypotension.",True

This is most commonly caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA).

Reasoning: The patient's neurological exam suggests a severe head injury. The description includes the patient not opening their eyes to stimuli, absent speech, withdrawal from pain, and anisocoria (unequal pupils). The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense collection, which is typical of an acute subdural hematoma. An epidural hematoma is typically lens-shaped. Intraparenchymal hematoma would be within the brain tissue. A subgaleal hematoma is external to the skull. A chronic subdural hematoma would typically be hypodense or isodense, not hyperdense.",False,A,"IT0095, A
Reasoning: The patient's neurological examination suggests a significant head injury. He is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli, indicating a decreased level of consciousness. The anisocoria (unequal pupil size), with the right pupil being larger than the left, suggests possible compression of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) on the right side, which can be caused by a mass effect. Given the trauma, the most likely finding on CT scan would be an intraparenchymal hematoma (A), which can directly damage the brain tissue and cause mass effect. Subdural and epidural hematomas (C and D) are also possibilities in trauma, but an intraparenchymal hematoma is a frequent and often critical finding in severe head injuries. Chronic subdural hematoma (B) is less likely given the acute presentation. A subgaleal hematoma (E) is outside of the skull and does not directly compress the brain and would not explain anisocoria.",False

The mechanism of injury described (fall on outstretched hand with shoulder abducted and extended) is also typical for an anterior dislocation.",True,B,"IT0111, B
Reasoning: The mechanism of injury (fall on outstretched hand with shoulder abducted and extended) is highly suggestive of an anterior glenohumeral dislocation. The patient description is classic for an anterior shoulder dislocation. A fracture of the greater tuberosity (trochite), glenoid cavity, or acromioclavicular joint dislocation are less likely given the mechanism of injury.

Reasoning: The image shows a side view of the lumbar spine, displaying the vertebral bodies stacked on top of each other from front to back. This represents a sagittal plane.

Quale indagine è la più appropriata per identificare la presenza di metastasi ossee?,A,True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: In cases where bone metastasis is suspected, a bone scan (scintigrafia ossea) is the most appropriate initial imaging study. A bone scan is highly sensitive for detecting areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic disease. While CT scans can also detect bone metastases, a bone scan offers whole-body coverage and is more sensitive for early detection. Therefore, option A is the most suitable choice. Options B, C, and E involve TC, while useful, are not usually the first choice for screening the whole skeleton for metastases due to radiation and are more detailed for specific areas. Option D, ultrasound, is not suitable for evaluating bone.",True,A,"IT0131, A
Reasoning: The question asks for the most appropriate investigation to identify bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy is a highly sensitive technique for detecting bone metastases because it highlights areas of increased bone turnover, which is characteristic of metastatic disease. While CT scans can also detect bone metastases, they are generally less sensitive than bone scintigraphy for detecting early lesions. TC of the entire spine is too limited in scope. A whole-body CT scan with contrast is not always necessary and exposes the patient to more radiation and contrast. Ultrasound is not suitable for skeletal imaging. Low-dose CT can be useful but isn't the gold standard screening method, especially if there's a strong suspicion from the MRI. Therefore, bone scintigraphy is the most appropriate choice.",True

Reasoning: The endoscopic image shows loss of villi, which is indicative of mucosal atrophy. This is a common finding in malabsorption syndromes such as celiac disease, which could explain the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea. There are no signs of fistulas, abscesses, neoplasm, bleeding, or ulcers. Therefore, the most appropriate deduction is atrophy of the mucosa.",True,B,"IT0136, B

Reasoning: The image shows multiple well-defined, round opacities in both lungs, which is consistent with pulmonary metastases, particularly the ""cannonball"" appearance. Other options are less likely given the size and shape of the lesions. Miliary tuberculosis would present with smaller, more diffuse nodules.

Reasoning: The image shows significant signs of decomposition, including discoloration (likely marbling), bloating (though it's hard to ascertain the extent of it from a single image), and the presence of insect activity (maggots). Given that the rigidity has resolved completely, the time since death is likely beyond the initial 24-48 hours. The level of decomposition suggests that it's unlikely to be just under 24 hours. One month or more would lead to more advanced decay (skeletonization). A few days (3-5) fits better considering the presence of insects. The weather in Sicily in August will accelerate the decomposition process. The question mentions ""complete resolution of rigor mortis,"" that occurs typically within 36 hours. Then, the presence of putrefaction signs, insects activity, discoloration suggests the passage of more time than 24-36 hours, so the more plausible answer is 3-5 days.",True,A,"IT0229, A
Reasoning: The question describes a body found in Sicily in August, with the windows open, and complete resolution of rigor mortis. Rigor mortis typically resolves after 36-72 hours (1.5-3 days). Given the warm climate and open windows, decomposition could be accelerated. Therefore, 3-5 days is the most plausible timeframe among the options. Less than 24 hours wouldn't allow for full rigor to set in and resolve. The other options are far too long given that rigor mortis has resolved.",True

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left frontoparietal region, consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient's history of hypertension and liver cirrhosis, coupled with the sudden onset of headache, vomiting, aphasia, and right hemiparesis, strongly suggests spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage. An acute subdural hematoma would likely present with a crescent shape along the dura. Epidural hematomas typically present with a lucid interval. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is usually associated with a different pattern of blood distribution. Finally, while ischemic stroke is possible, the CT scan evidence strongly supports intraparenchymal bleeding.",True,C,"IT0235, C
Reasoning: The patient presents with sudden onset headache and vomiting followed by aphasia and right hemiparesis. The patient has a history of hypertension and alcoholism with liver cirrhosis. The CT scan shows a hyperdense lesion in the left fronto-parietal region, indicating an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The location of the hemorrhage corresponds to the patient's symptoms (aphasia due to involvement of language areas in the left hemisphere, and right hemiparesis due to involvement of the motor cortex). The hypertension and alcohol-related liver disease are risk factors for intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
An epidural hematoma is less likely because it usually occurs after trauma. A subdural hematoma is also less likely, and the CT scan does not show the typical crescent shape. An ischemic stroke would not present with headache and vomiting initially. Subarachnoid hemorrhage would typically present with a severe headache (""thunderclap headache"") and meningeal signs, which are not mentioned in the case description. Thus, the most probable diagnosis is intraparenchymal hemorrhage.",True

Reasoning: The question describes a 76-year-old woman with progressive right arm weakness and language difficulties (expressive aphasia). The MRI shows an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal lobe with contrast enhancement and dural tail. These findings are highly suggestive of a meningioma. The tumor location is on the right side, causing deficits on the right. Therefore, the meningioma must be on the right frontal convexity to cause those deficits. Option A proposes a meningioma of the left frontal convexity. However, the image clearly demonstrates the lesion is on the right side. This makes Option A incorrect. Considering the symptoms are on the RIGHT side, the mass shown on the image also on the RIGHT side, and the description pointing to a extra-axial lesion, we have to change to Option A.

The extra-axial location, contrast enhancement, and dural tail are classic features of meningiomas. Gliomas are intra-axial. Metastases typically appear as multiple lesions. Subdural hematomas are typically crescent-shaped. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage would not typically have a dural tail.
Given the image showing a single mass on the RIGHT side, and the woman suffering deficits on the RIGHT side, with the mass description indicating possible ""meningioma della convessità frontale DESTRA"", the lesion MUST be on the RIGHT side to cause deficits on the RIGHT side.
However, the options state ""Meningioma della convessità frontale SINISTRA"", so even though all other descriptions match Meningioma, it is still on the WRONG SIDE.

A) Meningioma della convessità frontale sinistra: Incorrect location, but otherwise fits.
B) Glioma frontale sinistro di alto grado: Incorrect location and type of lesion.
C) Metastasi temporale destra da carcinoma mammario: Could cause symptoms, but doesn't fit the description as well.
D) Ematoma sottodurale acuto fronto-parietale sinistro: Doesn't fit the description or image.
E) Emorragia intraparenchimale spontanea frontale destra: Doesn't fit description or image, though could cause symptoms.

Since all others are so wrong, I have to choose A even though the location is supposedly ""wrong"" based on my better understanding of the situation.
The question must be using a weird convention.
Another possibility is the examiner made a mistake and A SHOULD have been right (but with the location being RIGHT).",True,A,"IT0236, A
Reasoning: The description points to a slowly progressive neurological deficit (weakness in the right arm, expressive aphasia) combined with an extra-axial lesion in the right frontal lobe that enhances homogeneously with contrast and has a dural tail. This is highly suggestive of a meningioma. Given the right frontal location and resulting deficits, and that the deficits are lateralized to the right, A is incorrect since the lesion is not found on the LEFT side. The most appropriate answer from those given is A as meningiomas of the convexity are common and the location is appropriate to give those symptoms. Gliomas are typically intra-axial. Metastasis is possible but less likely. Ematoma sottodurale or intra parenchymal haemorrhage usually don't have enhancement and can be considered unlikely given the chronicity of symptom development.",True

Reasoning: The description points towards an osteoid osteoma, given the age of the patient (19 years old), the intense nocturnal pain in the thigh, and the pain relief after taking acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). The imaging shows a lytic nidus with surrounding sclerosis which is characteristic for osteoid osteoma. The symptoms related to osteoid osteoma are typically relieved by NSAIDs like aspirin.",True,A,"IT0250, A
Reasoning: The clinical picture described - intense night pain in the thigh region in a 19-year-old, relieved by aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) - is highly suggestive of osteoid osteoma. While the radiologic confirmation is missing in the text, the question explicitly mentions the 'clinical-radiologic picture', suggesting the image (which I can't interpret) would support the answer. Aspirin sensitivity is a key characteristic of osteoid osteoma. The other options are less likely: chondroblastoma usually affects the epiphysis of long bones and typically occurs in the 10-25 age range (but is less associated with aspirin relief). Chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma are generally more aggressive tumors and less likely to present with pain relieved by aspirin. Enchondroma is usually asymptomatic.",True

Reasoning: The question asks which therapy is NOT indicated for the lesions. The image and description suggest condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgical excision are all appropriate treatments for condylomata. Topical salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used for condylomata acuminata and would be ineffective. Therefore, option E is the least appropriate treatment.",True,E,"IT0311, E
Reasoning: The description of the perineal lesions (rose-brown papules, sometimes confluent into plaques, asymptomatic) suggests condylomata acuminata or other benign skin lesions. Sinecatechins, podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and surgery are all established treatments for condylomata acuminata. Salicylic acid and corticosteroids are not typically used for condylomata acuminata, and corticosteroids may even worsen the condition by suppressing the immune response. Therefore, topical therapy with salicylic acid and corticosteroids is the least indicated.",True

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a significant absence of lung markings on the left side, along with a clear demarcation line suggesting a collapsed lung and air in the pleural space. This is characteristic of a left pneumothorax. The heart is also shifted to the right side, also consistent with a pneumothorax on the left. An extreme cardiomegaly would be visible with an enlarged heart, hemothorax would show fluid density in the hemithorax, tracheal stenosis would be at the level of the trachea, and aortic dissection is difficult to diagnose on plain radiograph.",True,C,"IT0340, C

Reasoning: The CT scan shows a crescent-shaped hyperdense collection along the inner table of the skull. This is characteristic of an acute subdural hematoma. The hematoma is causing significant mass effect, as evidenced by the midline shift. The shape of the hematoma is concave, following the shape of the skull. An epidural hematoma would typically have a biconvex shape. An intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraparenchymal hematoma would have different appearances on the CT scan.

Reasoning: The patient presents with acute dyspnea, hypotension, and hypoxemia. He is also a smoker and recently underwent prostatectomy, which increases the risk of thromboembolism. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia and signs that could be consistent with right heart strain, which is common in pulmonary embolism, such as S1Q3T3, T wave inversion in leads V1-V3, and right axis deviation (although right axis deviation is difficult to confirm with this ECG). While these are not definitive, the clinical picture supports the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. Brugada syndrome typically presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death and would have a different ECG pattern. Aortic dissection typically presents with severe chest pain and may have unequal pulses. While heart failure can cause dyspnea, the ECG does not show specific signs of hypertensive cardiomyopathy (e.g., left ventricular hypertrophy). Anemia can cause dyspnea but wouldn't cause this ECG pattern.",True,B,"IT0456, B
Reasoning: The patient presents with dyspnea, hypotension (100/50 mmHg), and hypoxia (SpO2 88%). He is a 70-year-old hypertensive smoker who recently underwent prostatectomy. These factors increase the risk of acute pulmonary embolism. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern. While the ECG is not perfectly diagnostic for PE, combined with the clinical scenario, acute pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis.
A) Brugada syndrome typically presents with syncope or sudden cardiac death and characteristic ECG findings that are not consistent with this patient's ECG.
C) Aortic dissection typically presents with severe chest pain, and while hypertension is a risk factor, the ECG findings and post-operative status are not supportive of this diagnosis.
D) Heart failure due to hypertensive cardiomyopathy could cause dyspnea, but the acute onset and post-operative status are more suggestive of PE. Also, the blood pressure would more likely be high, and the ECG changes are not typical for hypertensive heart failure.

Option E is incorrect because the fracture line is not through the femoral neck.",False,B,"IT0507, B
Reasoning: The radiograph shows a fracture involving the greater and lesser trochanters of the left femur. This is the region defining a pertrochanteric fracture.

Reasoning: The patient presents with progressive neurological deficits (difficulty walking, speech disturbance, right-sided weakness) that developed over days to weeks after a head trauma. He also has risk factors such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin. The CT scan reveals a crescent-shaped hematoma that is isodense/hypodense relative to the brain parenchyma. This indicates a chronic subdural hematoma.

Reasoning: The patient is presenting with classic symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (chest pain, diaphoresis).

The next step should be emergent coronary angiography to visualize and treat the occluded coronary artery. This should be done in <2 hours.",True,D,"IT0597, D
Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain, diaphoresis, and jugular constriction, which are suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He also has risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension and dyslipidemia). Given these symptoms and risk factors, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) needs to be ruled out. An ECG is crucial, and further imaging is needed to clarify whether an AMI or unstable angina has occurred. The ECG is not provided so let us make assumptions. If the ECG shows ST-segment elevation (STEMI), immediate coronary angiography is needed to restore blood flow. Even if the ECG is not diagnostic (NSTEMI or unstable angina), given the high-risk features (chest pain, profuse sweating, jugular distension), an emergency coronary angiography within 2 hours is indicated. A CT angiogram is usually not the next step for this presentation since time is crucial. Troponin is important, but will delay action, as will viral, etc. labs. Urgent angiography (24 hours) is not as immediate as should occur. Therefore, the best next step is coronary angiography in emergency (<2h).",True

Reasoning: The image shows a fundus with widespread retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and tortuous retinal veins, suggesting a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The patient's age, hypertension, and heart condition are also risk factors for CRVO. While branch retinal vein occlusion could be considered, the hemorrhages are more widespread than typically seen in a BRVO, and the clinical history is less suggestive. The other options are less consistent with the retinal findings. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy would not typically present with such extensive hemorrhages.

Option B is incorrect because the CT scan clearly shows a pathological finding.",True,C,"IT0676, C
Reasoning: The CT scan shows a hyperdense area in the left parieto-occipital region. The hyperdensity suggests blood, indicating a hemorrhage. The location of the hemorrhage within the brain tissue points towards a parenchymal hemorrhage rather than subdural or epidural, which would be located in the spaces outside the brain parenchyma.

Reasoning: The patient presents with chest discomfort and nausea, with a history of diabetes. The ECG shows some T-wave inversions in the anterior leads (V1-V4), which may indicate ischemia. Although the ECG isn't overtly diagnostic of STEMI, the clinical presentation and history of diabetes (which can mask typical symptoms) warrant a high index of suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Reasoning: The radiograph shows a widening of the physis/growth plate of the proximal humerus. This, in conjunction with the history of trauma in a 10 year old, is highly suggestive of a Salter-Harris type I fracture, which is a physeal separation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is proximal humeral epiphyseal separation. While other options might present with pain following trauma, this radiographic appearance is classic for a Salter-Harris type I injury. Fracture of the clavicle would show a fracture line. An enchondroma would not usually present with a history of trauma. Sarcoma of Ewing is possible but less likely given the history of recent trauma, and it would probably present with more aggressive bone destruction.

Reasoning: The description includes acute knee pain and moderate joint swelling after a twisting injury, a feeling of knee locking, and limited range of motion (20-90 degrees). These symptoms are highly suggestive of a meniscal tear. The phrase ""lesione a manico di secchio"" translates to ""bucket handle tear"" in English. A bucket handle tear is a specific type of meniscal tear where a portion of the meniscus is displaced, causing mechanical symptoms like locking. The arthroscopic image (Fig A) and MRI image (Fig B) would likely show the displaced meniscal fragment if available for review, but even without them, the clinical scenario points towards this diagnosis.

Reasoning: The radiogram shows a classic ""bird's beak"" appearance of the distal esophagus, which is characteristic of achalasia. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation, and the radiographic finding support this diagnosis. An upper endoscopy was performed and no cancerous lesions were found, therefore this also supports the diagnosis of achalasia. GIST of the gastric fundus is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings. A symptomatic hiatal hernia could cause similar symptoms but would not produce the bird's beak deformity.

Reasoning: The patient presents with chest pain exacerbated by breathing, tachypnea, reduced breath sounds on the left, and hypoxemia/hypocapnia (likely due to hyperventilation). The X-ray shows a complete absence of lung markings on the left side, with a visible visceral pleura line, suggesting a large pneumothorax. Given the size of the pneumothorax and the patient's respiratory distress, urgent chest tube placement is indicated. pH is slightly alkalotic (likely due to hyperventilation). A massive pneumothorax explains the findings.
The other options are less likely:
- B) Bronchopneumonia would show consolidation on the X-ray.
- C) An apical pneumothorax is usually smaller and less symptomatic, and the radiograph shows it is larger and the respiratory distress calls for drainage.
- D) A pleural effusion would have a different appearance on X-ray, with blunting of the costophrenic angle.
- E) While heart failure can cause respiratory distress, the X-ray findings are inconsistent with pulmonary edema (no Kerley B lines, etc.) and more consistent with a pneumothorax.",True,A,"IT0861, A
Reasoning: The patient presents with left-sided chest pain exacerbated by breathing, tachypnea, and decreased breath sounds on the left side. The blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia (PaO2 62 mmHg) and hypocapnia (PaCO2 28 mmHg), suggesting hyperventilation. The chest X-ray (although without details) strongly suggests a large pneumothorax on the left side, evidenced by the apparent absence of lung markings and a visible pleural line. A massive pneumothorax can cause significant respiratory distress and hypoxemia, necessitating urgent chest tube placement. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate.",True

Reasoning: The peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells). The presence of schistocytes is indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is a condition in which red blood cells are damaged and destroyed as they pass through small blood vessels. Therefore, the best answer is E.

Reasoning: The question describes an 85-year-old patient with melena and microcytic hypochromic anemia. EGDS reveals a finding in the antrum. The image (although very unclear) seems to show an ulcer with a dark spot in its base. According to the Forrest classification, Forrest IIc indicates an ulcer with a flat spot.

Reasoning: The description mentions a rapidly growing lesion with comedo-like openings and pseudo-cysts, which is suggestive of seborrheic keratosis. The image shows multiple pigmented lesions with these features. The lesions are raised and have a ""stuck-on"" appearance, which is consistent with seborrheic keratosis. Given the clinical description and dermatoscopic findings, pigmented seborrheic keratosis is the most likely diagnosis. While the patient has a history of melanoma, the dermatoscopic findings are more characteristic of seborrheic keratosis than melanoma.

Reasoning: The description points towards seborrheic keratosis. The key elements are: multiple lesions of different sizes on the chest and neck, light brown color, rough texture, and dermatoscopic findings of comedo-like openings and pseudocysts. These are all consistent with seborrheic keratosis. The fact that the patient had a previous melanoma is a distractor. The rapid growth is also consistent with seborrheic keratosis.

Reasoning: The spirometry results show that both FVC and FEV1 are significantly reduced compared to the reference values (Rif), as shown by the percentage of reference values (57% and 60%, respectively). This indicates a reduction in lung volumes. The FEV1/FVC ratio is 78%, which is within the normal range. These findings suggest a restrictive ventilatory defect, as the reduction in both FEV1 and FVC, with a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio, is characteristic of restrictive lung diseases. Option A is incorrect because the lung volumes are not within normal limits. Option B is incorrect because the volumes are reduced, not increased. Option D is incorrect because the FEV1/FVC ratio is not reduced, and there is no indication of reversibility. Option E is incorrect because the data provided doesn't necessarily correlate with hyperresponsiveness.",True,C,"IT1044, C
Reasoning: The question describes a 67-year-old woman with dyspnea on exertion undergoing spirometry.

The patient is symptomatic with weakness, headache, and dizziness, suggesting hemodynamic compromise due to the slow heart rate. The most appropriate treatment for symptomatic complete heart block is pacemaker implantation.

Reasoning: The ECG shows a complete heart block (AV block). The symptoms described (weakness, headache, and dizziness) are consistent with reduced cardiac output due to the slow heart rate. The most appropriate treatment for complete heart block is implantation of a pacemaker. Cardioversion and defibrillation are used for tachyarrhythmias. Midodrine is used for hypotension.

1,IT1100,La tabella sottostante espone i risultati di uno studio caso-controllo. Quale tra i seguenti è il calcolo corretto per quantificare l’associazione tra la malattia e il fattore di rischio?,D,True,E,"IT1100, E
Reasoning: The question asks for the correct calculation to quantify the association between a disease and a risk factor in a case-control study. The most appropriate measure for case-control studies is the Odds Ratio. The formula for the Odds Ratio (OR) is (cells a*d)/(cells b*c) where a is the number of exposed with the disease, b is the number of exposed without the disease, c is the number of unexposed with the disease, and d is the number of unexposed without the disease. Given the data in the table: a = 250, b = 150, c = 100, d = 400. Therefore the correct formula is (250*400)/(150*100), which is not among the given choices, but the reverse of that is shown in option E, (150*400)/(250*100).

The question is how to quantify the association between the *disease* and the *risk factor*. The question refers to a study of case-control type. In case-control studies, we calculate the odds ratio.

Malati Non malati Totale
Esposti 250 150 400
Non esposti 100 400 500

Odds Ratio = (Esposti Malati / Esposti Non Malati) / (Non esposti Malati / Non esposti Non malati)
Odds Ratio = (250 / 150) / (100 / 400)
Odds Ratio = (250 * 400) / (150 * 100)
Thus the correct option should have 150*100 as the denominator and 250*400 as the numerator, which corresponds to D.

After double checking:
Disease
Present (Cases) | Absent (Controls)
-----------------|-----------------
Present (Exposed) | 250 | 150
Absent (Unexposed) | 100 | 400

Odds Ratio = (a*d) / (b*c) = (250*400)/(150*100).
However, the correct option is (150*400)/(250*100), after checking, this should be option E and not D.

IT1100, D
Reasoning: A case-control study uses the odds ratio to measure the association between exposure and outcome. The odds ratio is calculated as (a*d)/(b*c), where 'a' is the number of exposed individuals with the disease, 'b' is the number of exposed individuals without the disease, 'c' is the number of unexposed individuals with the disease, and 'd' is the number of unexposed individuals without the disease.
From the table:
a = 250
b = 150
c = 100
d = 400
Therefore, the odds ratio is (250*400)/(150*100). Option D has this calculation.

Reasoning: The question asks for the typical imaging appearance of a subdural hematoma. A subdural hematoma typically appears as a crescent-shaped (or ""falce"" in Italian) collection of blood that conforms to the shape of the skull. An epidural hematoma, on the other hand, appears as a biconvex lens.
The image shows the ""falce"" appearance.
Option A refers to a ""sunburst"" appearance which is not related to hematomas.
Option C is not a standard radiological description.
Option E is similar to B, as a biconvex lens shape is typical of epidural hematomas.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.",True,D,"IT1118, D
Reasoning: A subdural hematoma is typically crescent-shaped because it can spread along the inner surface of the dura, following the curvature of the brain. This creates the appearance of a ""falx"" or ""crescent"" shape on imaging, especially CT scans. An epidural hematoma usually has a biconvex (lens) shape because it is confined by the sutures of the skull.",True
